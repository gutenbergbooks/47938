<h2>PREFACE</h2>
<hr class="r10" />

<p>The present volume, as explained by the title, consists
mainly of a reprint of the Cartwright Lectures for 1894.
These lectures were originally printed in the current numbers
of the Medical Record, but so many requests have
been made for their publication in a more convenient and
accessible form that they are now re-issued, through the
courtesy of the publishers of the Record, in book-form.</p>

<p>It is hoped that these lectures may prove of value not
only in calling attention to some of the fundamental
chemico-physiological facts of digestion, but in stimulating
closer investigation of the many questions which are so
intimately associated with a proper understanding of the
processes concerned in the digestion and utilization of the
proteid food-stuffs.</p>

<h2>LECTURE I.</h2>

<h3>THE GENERAL NATURE OF PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES AND OF
PROTEIDS.</h3>


<h4>INTRODUCTORY.</h4>

<p>In digestive proteolysis we have a branch of physiological
study which of late years has made much progress. Chemistry
has come to the aid of physiology and by the combined
efforts of the two our knowledge of the digestive processes
of the alimentary tract has been gradually broadened and
deepened. That which at one time appeared simple has
become complex, but increasing knowledge has brought
not only recognition of existing complexity, but has enabled
us, in part at least, to unravel it.</p>

<p>By digestive proteolysis is to be understood the transformation
of the proteid food-stuffs into more or less soluble
and diffusible products through the agency of the digestive
juices, or more especially through the activity of the so-called
proteolytic ferments or enzymes contained therein;
changes which plainly have for their object a readier and
more complete utilization of the proteid foods by the
system.</p>

<p>In selecting this topic as the subject for this series of
Cartwright Lectures I have been influenced especially by
the opinion that both for the physiologist and the physician
there are few processes going on in the animal body of
greater importance than those classed under the head of
digestion. Further, few processes are less understood than
those concerned in this broad question of digestive proteolysis,
especially those which relate specifically to the digestion
of the various classes of proteid food-stuffs, and to the<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
absorption and utilization of the several products formed.
Moreover, the subject has ever had for me a strong attraction
as presenting a field of investigation where chemical work
can advantageously aid in the advance of sound physiological
knowledge; and certainly every line of advance in our
understanding of the normal processes of the body paves
the way for a better and clearer comprehension of the
pathological or abnormal processes to which the human
body is subject.</p>

<p>You will pardon me if I specially emphasize in this
connection the fact that advance along the present lines was
not rapid until physiologists began to appreciate the importance
of investigating the chemico-physiological problems
of digestion by accurate chemical methods. Something
more than simple test-tube study, or even experimental work
on animals, is required in dealing with the changes which
complex proteids undergo in gastric and pancreatic digestion.
The nature and chemical composition of the proteids
undergoing digestion, as well as of the resultant products,
are necessary preliminaries to any rightful interpretation of
the changes accompanying digestive proteolysis; but
physiology has been slow to appreciate the significance of
this fact, and, until recently, has done very little to remedy
the noticeable lack of accurate knowledge regarding the
composition and nature of the proteid and albuminoid substances
which play such an important part in the life-history
of the human organism, either as food or as vital constituents
of the physio­logically active and inactive tissues. This is
to be greatly deprecated, since our understanding of the
nature of proteolysis, of the mode of action of the enzymes
or ferments involved, and of the relationships of the products
formed, is dependent mainly upon an accurate determination
of the exact changes in chemical composition
which accompany each step in the proteolytic process.<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
How otherwise can we hope to attain a proper appreciation
of the real points of difference between bodies so closely
related as those composing the large group of proteids and
albuminoids? Surely, in no other way can we measure the
nature or extent of the changes involved in the various
phases of proteolysis than by a thorough study of chemical
composition and constitution, as well as of chemical reactions
and general properties.</p>

<p>In the early history of physiology there was, quite naturally,
little or no thought given to the nature of proteolytic
changes. The gastric juice, as one of the first digestive
fluids to be studied, was recognized as a kind of universal
solvent for all varieties of food-stuffs, and this even long
before anything was known regarding its composition, but
beyond this point knowledge did not extend. Active study
of the gastric juice, as you well know, dates from 1783,
when the brilliant Italian investigator Spallanzani commenced
his work on digestion. The names of Carminati,
Werner and <span class="nowrap">Montégre<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span> are also associated with various
phases of work and speculation in this early history of the
subject, especially those which pertained to the possible
presence of acid in the stomach juices. In 1824, however,
Prout showed conclusively that gastric juice was truly acid,
and, moreover, that the acidity was due to the presence of
free hydrochloric acid, and not to an organic acid. Still,
many observations failed to show the presence of an acid
fluid in the stomach, and it was not until Tiedemann and
Gmelin’<span class="nowrap">s<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> masterly researches were published that the cause
of this discrepancy was made clear. It was then seen that
the secretion of an acid gastric juice was dependent upon
stimulation or irritation of the mucous membrane of the<span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>
stomach, and that so long as the stomach was free from food
or other matter capable of stimulating the mucosa, it contained
very little fluid, and that neutral or very slightly
acid in reaction. These early observers also recorded the
fact that the amount or strength of acid increased with the
outpouring of the secretion, incidental to natural or artificial
stimulation, thus giving a hint of the now well-known fact
that any and every secretion may show variations in composition
incidental to the character and extent of the stimulation
which calls it forth.</p>

<p>The period between 1825 and 1833 was characterized
especially by the presentation of the many results bearing
on gastric digestion obtained by Dr. Beaumont on Alexis
St. Martin, followed a little later, in 1842, by a long period
of experimenta­tion by many physiologists, as Blondlot<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>
Bassow<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> Bardeleben<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> Bernard<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> Bidder and Schmidt<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> and
many others on methods of establishing gastric fistulæ on
animals, by which many interesting results were accumulated
regarding the physiology of gastric digestion. Up to
1834, however, there was no adequate explanation offered
of the solvent power of the stomach juice; aside from the
presence of hydrochloric acid, nothing could be discovered
by the earlier chemists to account for the remarkable digestive
action. Eberle<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> however, attributed to the mucous
membrane of the stomach a catalytic action, and claimed
that it only needed the presence of a small piece of the
stomach mucosa with weak hydrochloric acid for the manifestation
of solvent or digestive power. It remained for
Schwann<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span> to show the true explanation of this phenomenon,<span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>
and although he was unable to make a complete separation
of the active principle which he plainly believed existed,
he gave to it the name of pepsin. Wassmann, Pappenheim<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span>
Valentin, and later Elsässer<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> all endeavored to obtain the
substance in a pure form, and Wassmann<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span> in 1839, surely
succeeded in obtaining a very active preparation of the ferment&mdash;one
capable of exerting marked digestive action
when mixed with a little dilute acid. Thus, a true understanding
of the general nature of gastric juice was finally
arrived at, and the cause of its digestive power was rightfully
attributed to the presence of the ferment pepsin and
the dilute acid. Further, the analysis of human gastric
juice made by Berzelius<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> in 1834, showed that the secretion
contains very little solid matter (1.26 per cent.), thus calling
attention to the fact that the digestive power of this
fluid is out of all proportion to the amount of pepsin, or
even to the amount of total solid matter present, and
consequently paving the way for a general appreciation of
the peculiar nature of the dominant body, <i>i.e.</i>, the pepsin.</p>

<p>The original conception regarding the manner in which
gastric juice exerts its solvent power on proteid foods was
apparently limited to simple solution; chemical solution if
you choose, brought about by catalytic action, but without
any hint as to the possible nature of the soluble products
formed. Mialhe<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></span> however, recognized the fact that this
transformation, by which insoluble and non-diffusible proteid
matter was converted into a soluble and diffusible product,
was a form of hydration, comparable to the change of
insoluble starch into soluble sugar, and he named the
hypothetical product albuminose. Mialhe’s study of the<span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
matter in 1846 was followed by Lehmann’<span class="nowrap">s<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> investigation
of the subject, and the coining of the word peptones as an
appropriate name for the soluble products of gastric digestion.
The peptones isolated by Lehmann were described as
amorphous, tasteless substances, soluble in water in all proportions
and insoluble in alcohol. They were likewise precipitated
by tannic acid, mercuric chloride, and lead acetate,
and were considered as weak acid bodies, having the power
of combining with bases to form salts of a more or less
indefinite character. Twelve years later, in 1858, <span class="nowrap">Mulder<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span>
gave a more complete description of peptones, but his study
of the subject failed to advance materially our knowledge
of the broader questions regarding the nature of the process,
or processes, by which the so-called peptones were
formed. A year later, in 1859, <span class="nowrap">Meissner<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></span> brought forward
the first of his contributions, and during the following
three or four years several communications were made
representing the work of himself and pupils upon the question
of gastric digestion, or more especially upon the
character of the products resulting from the digestive
action of pepsin-hydrochloric acid.</p>

<p>The general tenor of Meissner’s results is shown in the
description of a row of products as characteristic of the
proteolytic action of pepsin-acid on proteid matter. In
other words, there was a clear recognition of the fact that
proteid digestion in the stomach, through the agency of the
ferment pepsin, is something more than a simple conversion
of the proteid into one or two soluble products. The
several bodies then isolated were named parapeptone,
metapeptone, dyspeptone, α, β, and γ peptone; names now
seldom used, but significant as showing that at this early<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
date there was a full appreciation of the fact that digestive
proteolysis as accomplished by the ferment pepsin is an
intricate process, accompanied by the formation of a series
of products which vary more or less with the conditions
under which the digestion is conducted.</p>

<p>This was the commencement of our more modern ideas
regarding digestive proteolysis, but only the commencement,
for it ushered in an era of unparalleled activity, in
which Brücke, Schützenberger, and Kühne each contributed
a large share toward the successful interpretation of
the results obtained. Further, knowledge regarding the
proteid-digesting power of the pancreatic juice was rapidly
accumulating, thus broadening our ideas regarding digestive
proteolysis in general. <span class="nowrap">Corvisart<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> had called attention
to the proteolytic power of the pancreatic juice in 1857,
and although his observations were more or less generally
discredited for a time, they were eventually confirmed by
Meissner<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span> Schiff, Danilewsky<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> and Kühne<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> the latter
particularly contributing greatly to the development of our
knowledge concerning this phase of digestive proteolysis.
The proteolytic power was proved to be due to a specific
ferment or enzyme, now universally called trypsin, which
digests proteid foods to the best advantage in the presence
of sodium carbonate. Digestive proteolysis in the human
body was thus shown to be due mainly to the presence of
two distinct enzymes, the one active in an acid fluid, the
gastric juice, the other in an alkaline-reacting fluid, the
pancreatic juice, but both endowed with the power of
digesting all varieties of proteid foods, with the formation
of a large number of more or less closely related products.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="8"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a></span></p>

<p>So much for the early history of our subject, and now,
without attempting any exhaustive sketch of its gradual
development during the last decade and a half, allow me
to present to you digestive proteolysis as it stands to-day,
developed somewhat, I trust, by the results I have been
able to contribute to it during the last twelve years.</p>


<h4>THE GENERAL NATURE OF PROTEOLYTIC ENZYMES.</h4>

<p>These peculiar bodies owe their origin to the constructive
power of the gland-cells from which the respective secretions
are derived. During fasting, the epithelial cells of
the gastric glands and of the pancreas manufacture from
the cell-protoplasm a specific zymogen or ferment-antecedent,
which is stored up in the cell in the form of granules.
These granules of either pepsinogen or trypsinogen, as the
case may be, are during secretion apparently drawn upon for
the production of the ferment, and it is an easy matter to
verify Langley’<span class="nowrap">s<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> observation that the amount of pepsin,
for example, obtainable from a definite weight of the gland-bearing
mucous membrane is proportionate to the number
of granules contained in the gland-cells. During ordinary
secretion, however, these granules of zymogen do not
entirely disappear from the cell. When secretion commences
and the granules are drawn upon for the production
of ferment, fresh granules are formed, and inasmuch
as these latter are produced through the katabolism of the
cell-protoplasm it follows that anabolic processes must be
simultaneously going on in the cell, by which new cell-protoplasm
is constructed. Hence, as Heidenhain, Langley,
and others have pointed out, during digestion there are
at least three distinct processes going on side by side in<span class="pagenum" title="9"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9"></a></span>
the gland-cell, viz., the conversion of the zymogen stored
up in the cell into the active ferment, or other secretory
products, the growth of new cell-protoplasm, and the
attendant formation of fresh zymogen to replace, or partially
replace, that used up in the production of the ferment.
Consequently, we are to understand that in the living
mucous membrane of the stomach there is little or no
preformed pepsin present. Similarly, the cells of the pancreatic
gland are practically free from the ferment trypsin.
In both cases the cell-protoplasm stores up zymogen and
not the active ferment, but at the moment of secretion the
zymogen is transformed into ferment and possibly other
organic substances characteristic of the fluid secreted.
Absorption of the products of digestion tends to increase
the activity of the secreting cells, but we have no tangible
proof that any particular kinds of food are directly peptogenous,
<i>i.e.</i>, that they lead to a storing up in the gastric
cells, for example, of pepsinogen, although it may be that
the so-called peptogenous foods give rise to a more active
conversion of pepsinogen into pepsin<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> As already stated,
the zymogen is manufactured directly from the cell-protoplasm,
and the constructive power is certainly not directly
controlled by the character of the food ingested.</p>

<p>All this in one sense is to-day ancient history, but I
recall it to your minds in order to emphasize the fact that
these two energetic ferments or enzymes stand in close
relation to the protoplasm of the cell from which they
originate. So far as we can measure the transforma­tions
involved, there are only two distinct steps in the process,
viz., the formation of the inactive zymogen stored up in
the cell, and the conversion of the antecedent body into
the soluble and active ferment. In this connection Pod-<span class="pagenum" title="10"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a></span><span class="nowrap">wyssozki<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span>
has reported that the mucous membrane of the
stomach exposed to the action of oxygen gas shows a
marked increase in the amount of pepsin, from which he
infers that the natural conversion of pepsinogen into pepsin
is an oxidation process. Further, he claims the existence
of at least two forms of pepsinogen in the stomach mucosa,
one closely akin to the ferment itself and very easily
soluble in glycerin, while the other is more insoluble in
this menstruum. Langley and Edkins<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> however, find
that oxygen has no effect whatever on the pepsinogen
of the frog’s mucous membrane, thus throwing doubt on
the above conclusion. Still, <span class="nowrap">Podolinski<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></span> claims that trypsin
originates from its particular zymogen through a
process of oxidation, and <span class="nowrap">Herzen<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></span> has proved that the
ferment can be reconverted into trypsinogen under the
influence of carbon-monoxide and again transformed into
the ferment by contact with oxygen gas. This latter
<span class="nowrap">observer<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></span> has also noticed a connection between the
amount of trypsin obtainable from the pancreas and the
dilatation of the spleen, from which he was eventually led
to conclude that the spleen during its dilatation gives birth
to a zymogen-transforming ferment which thus leads to the
production of trypsin, presumably from the already manufactured
zymogen. In any event, their peculiar origin
lends favor to the view that these two enzymes are closely
allied to proteid bodies, and that they are directly derived
from the albuminous portion of the cell-protoplasm.
Analysis shows that they always contain nitrogen in fairly<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
large amount, although the percentage is sometimes less
than that found in a typical proteid body.</p>

<p>It must be remembered, however, that in spite of oft-repeated
attempts to obtain more definite knowledge
regarding the composition of these proteolytic enzymes our
efforts have been more or less baffled. We are confronted
at the outset with the fact that no criterion of chemical
purity exists, either in the way of chemical composition or
of chemical reactions. The only standard of purity available
is the intensity of proteolytic action, but this is so
dependent upon attendant circumstances that it is only
partially helpful in forming an estimate of chemical purity.
My own experiments in this direction, and they have been
quite numerous, have convinced me that it is practically
impossible to obtain a preparation of either pepsin or
trypsin at all active which does not show at least some
proteid reactions. Furthermore, such samples of these
two enzymes as I have analyzed have shown a composition
closely akin to that of proteid bodies. I will not take
time to go into all the details of my work in this direction,
contenting myself here with the statement that the purest
specimens of pepsin and trypsin I have been able to prepare
have always shown their relationship to the proteid
bodies by responding to many of the typical proteid reactions,
and their composition, though somewhat variable,
has in the main substantiated this evident relationship.</p>

<p>The most satisfactory method I have found for obtaining
a comparatively pure preparation of pepsin, and one at the
same time strongly active, is a modification of the method
published some years ago by Kühne and myself<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></span> The
mucous membrane from the cardiac portion of a pig’s
stomach is dissected off and washed with water. The
upper surface of the mucosa is then scraped with a knife<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
until at least half of the membrane is removed. These
scrapings, containing the fragments of the peptic glands,
are warmed at 40°&nbsp;C. with an abundance of 0.2 per cent.
hydrochloric acid for ten to twelve days in order to transform
all of the convertible albuminous matter into peptone.
The solution is then freed from insoluble matter by
filtration and immediately saturated with ammonium sulphate,
by which the pepsin, with some albumose, is precipitated
in the form of a more or less gummy, or
semi-adherent mass. This is filtered off, washed with a
saturated solution of ammonium sulphate and then dissolved
in 0.2 per cent. hydrochloric acid. The resultant
solution is next dialyzed in running water until the ammonium
salt is entirely removed, thymol being added to
prevent putrefaction, after which the fluid is mixed with
an equal volume of 0.4 per cent. hydrochloric acid and
again warmed at 40°&nbsp;C. for several days. The ferment is
then once more precipitated by saturation of the fluid with
ammonium sulphate, the precipitate strained off, dissolved
in 0.2 per cent. acid and again dialyzed in running water
until the solution is entirely free from sulphate. The
clear solution of the ferment obtained in this manner can
then be concentrated at 40°&nbsp;C. in shallow dishes, and if
desired the ferment obtained as a scaly residue. So prepared,
the pepsin is certainly quite pure, that is comparatively,
and although it may contain some albumose, the
latter must be very resistant to the action of the ferment;
indeed, pepsin is in many respects an albumose-like body
itself.</p>

<p>In any event, the enzyme prepared in this manner shows
decided proteid reactions, and contains nitrogen corresponding
more or less closely to the recognized composition
of an albumose. My own belief, therefore, is that these
enzymes, both pepsin and trypsin, are proteid bodies<span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
closely related to the albumoses. They are soluble in
water and more or less soluble in glycerin; at least glycerin
will dissolve them from moist tissues, or from moist precipitates
containing them. Langley<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></span> however, states, and
perhaps justly, that we have no positive proof that either
ferments or zymogens are soluble in pure strong glycerin,
and that if they are soluble, it is extremely slowly. In
dilute glycerin, however, these ferments dissolve readily,
as we very well know. Furthermore, they are practically
non-diffusible, and, like many albumoses, are precipitated
in part by saturation with sodium chloride and completely
on saturation with ammonium sulphate.</p>

<p>When dissolved in water and heated above 80°&nbsp;C., these
enzymes are decomposed to such an extent that their proteolytic
power is totally destroyed. The amount of coagulum
produced by heat, however, is comparatively small,
though variable with different preparations. Thus with
trypsin, Kühne originally considered that boiling an aqueous
solution of the ferment would give rise to about twenty
per cent. of coagulated proteid and eighty per cent. of
peptone-like matter. With the purer preparations now
obtainable there is apparently less coagulable matter
present, and <span class="nowrap">Loew<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></span> has succeeded in preparing from the
pancreas of the ox a sample of trypsin containing 52.75 per
cent. of carbon and 16.55 per cent. of nitrogen, and yielding
only a small coagulum by heat. Loew considered the
ferment to be a true peptone, but in view of our present
knowledge regarding the albumoses, I think we are justified
in assuming it to be an albumose-like body rather than
a true peptone. At the same time it may be well to again
emphasize the fact that our only “means of determining<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
the presence of an enzyme is that of ascertaining the
change which it is able to bring about in other substances,
and since the activity of the enzymes is extra­ordinarily
great, a minute trace suffices to produce a marked effect.
From this it follows that the purified enzymes which give
distinct proteid reactions might merely consist of very
small quantities of a true non-proteid enzyme, adherent to
or mixed with a residue of inert proteid material.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></span> This
quotation gives expression to a possibility which we certainly
cannot ignore, but my own experiments lead me to
believe firmly in the proteid nature of these two enzymes.
Further, we find partial substantiation of this view in the
results obtained by <span class="nowrap">Wurtz<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></span> in his study of the vegetable
proteolytic ferment papain, and in my own results from
the study of the proteolytic ferment of pineapple juice<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></span>
Thus, Wurtz prepared from the juice of Carica papaya an
active sample of papain, and found it to contain on analysis
about 16.7 per cent. of nitrogen and 52.5 per cent. of
carbon, while the reactions of the product likewise testified
to the proteid nature of the enzyme. Martin, too, has
concluded from his study of papain that the ferment is at
least associated with an albumose<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></span></p>

<p>With the proteolytic ferment of pineapple juice my
observations have led me to the following conclusions, viz.,
that the ferment is at least associated with a proteid body,
more or less completely precipitable from a neutral
solution by saturation with ammonium sulphate, sodium
chloride, and magnesium sulphate. This body is soluble
in water, and consequently is not precipitated by dialysis.
It is further non-coagulable by long contact with strong<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
alcohol, and its aqueous solution is very incompletely precipitated
by heat. Placing it in line with the known forms
of albuminous bodies it is not far removed from protoalbumose
or heteroalbumose, differing, however, from the
latter in that it is soluble in water without the addition of
sodium chloride. At the same time, it fails to show some
of the typical albumose reactions, and verges toward the
group of globulins. In any event, it shows many characteristic
proteid reactions, and contains considerable nitrogen,
viz., 10.46 per cent., with 50.7 per cent, of carbon.
Consequently, we may conclude that the chemical reactions
and composition of the more typical proteolytic enzymes,
both of animal and vegetable origin, all favor the view
that they are proteid bodies not far removed from the
albuminous matter of the cell-protoplasm.</p>

<p>Further, the very nature of these substances and their
mode of action strengthen the idea that they are not only
derived from the albumin of the cell-protoplasm, but that
they are closely related to it. One cannot fail to be
impressed with the resemblance in functional power
between the unformed ferments as a class and cell-protoplasm.
To what can we ascribe the particular functional
power of each individual ferment? Why, for example,
does pepsin act on proteid matter only in the presence of
acid, and trypsin to advantage only in the presence of
alkalies? Why does pepsin act only on proteid matter,
and ptyalin only on starch and dextrins? Why does
trypsin produce a different set of soluble products in the
digestion of albumin than pepsin does? Similarly, why is
it that the cell-protoplasm of one class of cells gives rise to
one variety of katabolic products, while the protoplasm of
another class of cells, as in a different tissue or organ, manifests
its activity along totally different lines? The answer
to both sets of questions is, I think, to be found in the<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
chemical constitution of the cell-protoplasm on the one
hand, and in the constitution of the individual enzymes on
the other. The varied functional power of the ferment is
a heritage from the cell-protoplasm, and, as I have said, is
suggestive of a close relationship between the enzymes and
the living protoplasm from which they originate. We
might, on purely theoretical grounds, consider that these
unformed ferments are isomeric bodies all derived from
different modifications of albumin and with a common general
structure, but with individual differences due to the
extent of the hypothetical polymerization which attends
their formation.</p>

<p>Whenever, owing to any cause, the activity of the ferment
is destroyed, as when it is altered by heat, strong
acids, or alkalies, then the death of the ferment is to be
attributed to a change in its constitution; the atoms in the
molecule are rearranged, and as a result the peculiar ferment
power is lost forever. The proteolytic power of
these enzymes is therefore bound up in the chemical constitution
of the bodies, and anything which tends to alter
the latter immediately interferes with their proteolytic
action. But how shall we explain the normal action of
these peculiar bodies? Intensely active, capable in themselves
of producing changes in large quantities of material
without being destroyed, their mere presence under suitable
conditions being all powerful to produce profound
alterations, these enzymes play a peculiar part. Present in
mere traces, they are able to transform many thousand
times their weight of proteid matter into soluble and
diffusible products. All that is essential is their mere
presence under suitable conditions, and strangely enough
the causative agent itself appears to suffer no marked
change from the reactions set up between the other substances.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span></p>

<p>There are many theories extant to explain this peculiar
method of chemical change, but few of them help us to
any real understanding of the matter. These enzymes are
typical catalytic or contact agents, and by their presence
render possible marked changes in the character of the
proteid or albuminoid matter with which they happen to
be in contact. But the conditions under which the contact
takes place exercise an important control over the activity
of the ferment. Temperature, reaction, concentration of
the fluid, presence or absence of various foreign substances,
etc., all play a very important part in regulating and controlling
the activity of these two proteolytic enzymes. In
fact, as one looks over the large number of data which
have gradually accumulated bearing upon this point, one
is impressed with the great sensitiveness of these ferments
toward even so-called indifferent substances. Their specific
activity appears to hinge primarily upon the existence
of a certain special environment, alterations of which may
be attended with an utter loss of proteolytic power, or, in
some less common cases, with a decided increase in the
rate of digestive action. This constitutes one of the
peculiar features of these proteolytic enzymes; powerful
to produce great changes, they are nevertheless subject to
the influence of their surroundings in a way which testifies
to their utter lack of stability. Furthermore, as you well
know, conditions favorable for the action of the one ferment
are absolutely unfavorable for the activity of the
other, and indeed may even lead to its destruction.
Thus, while pepsin requires for its activity the presence
of an acid, as 0.2 per cent. HCl, trypsin is completely
destroyed in such a medium. Again, trypsin
exhibits its peculiar proteolytic power in the presence of
sodium carbonate, a salt which has an immediate destructive
action upon pepsin. Hence, a medium which is favor<span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span>able
for the action of the one ferment may be directly
antagonistic to the action of the other.</p>

<p>Another factor of great moment in determining the
activity of these two enzymes is temperature. That which
is most favorable for their action is 38° to 40°&nbsp;C., and any
marked deviation from this temperature is attended by an
immediate effect upon the proteolysis. Exposure to a low
temperature simply retards proteolytic action, doubtless in
the same manner that cold checks or retards other chemical
changes. There is no destruction of the ferment,
even on exposure to extreme cold, the enzyme being
simply inactive for the time being. Exposure of either
pepsin or trypsin to a high temperature, say 80°&nbsp;C., is
quickly followed by a complete loss of proteolytic power,
<i>i.e.</i>, the ferment is destroyed. It is to be noticed, however,
that the destructive action of heat is greatly modified
by the attendant circumstances. Thus, fairly pure trypsin,
dissolved in 0.3 per cent. sodium carbonate, is completely
destroyed on exposure to a temperature of 50°&nbsp;C. for five
to six minutes, while a neutral or slightly acid solution of
the pure enzyme is destroyed in five minutes by exposure
to a temperature of 45°&nbsp;C. On the other hand, the presence
of inorganic salts and the products of digestion, such
as albumoses, amphopeptone, and antipeptone, all tend to
protect the trypsin somewhat from the destructive effects
of high temperatures, so that in their presence the enzyme
may be warmed to 60°&nbsp;C. before it shows any diminution
in proteolytic power. Alkaline reaction, combined with
the presence of salts and proteid, viz., just the conditions
existent in the natural pancreatic secretion, constitute the
best safeguard against the destructive action of heat, and
under such conditions trypsin may be warmed to about
60°&nbsp;C. before it begins to suffer harm. But all this testifies
in no uncertain way to the extreme sensitiveness of the<span class="pagenum" title="19"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a></span>
ferment to changes in temperature; a sensitiveness which
manifests itself not only in diminished or retarded proteolytic
action, but terminates in destruction of the ferment
when the temperature rises beyond a certain point.</p>

<p>Similarly, pepsin dissolved in 0.2 per cent. hydrochloric
acid feels the destructive effect of heat when a temperature
of 60°&nbsp;C. is reached. In a neutral solution, on the other
hand, destruction of the ferment may be complete at 55°&nbsp;C.
Here, too, peptone retards very noticeably the destructive
action of heat, especially in an acid solution of pepsin, so
that under such circumstances the ferment may not be
affected until the temperature reaches 70°&nbsp;C. I have tried
many experiments along this line, not only with pepsin and
trypsin, but also with many other ferments. We may
briefly summarize, however, all that is necessary for us
to consider here in the statement that the pure isolated
ferments are far more sensitive to the destructive action of
heat than when they are present in their natural secretions.
This, as stated, is due not only to the reaction of the
respective fluids but also to the protective or inhibitory
action of the inorganic salts and various proteids naturally
present. We may thus say with <span class="nowrap">Biernacki<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></span> that the purer
the ferment the less resistant it is to the effects of heat.</p>

<p>It is thus plain that these enzymes, capable though they
are of accomplishing great tasks, are nevertheless exceedingly
unstable and prone to lose their proteolytic power
under the slightest provocation. When, however, they are
surrounded by their natural environment, the acid or
alkali of the respective secretion, together with salts and
proteids, they then appear more stable; their natural lability
becomes for the time being transformed into semi-stability,
and the temperature, for example, at which they<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
lose their peculiar power, is raised ten degrees or more. I
have also found the same to be true of the vegetable proteolytic
ferments, and also of the amylolytic ferment of
saliva.</p>

<p>The above facts furnish us, I think, a good illustration
of how dependent these proteolytic enzymes are upon the
proper conditions of temperature, to say nothing of other
conditions, for the full exercise of their peculiar power.
Toward acids, alkalies, metallic salts, and many other compounds
they are even more sensitive than toward heat, and
much might be said regarding the effects, inhibitory or
otherwise, produced by a large number of common drugs
or medicinal agents on these two ferments. Any lengthy
discussion of this matter, however, would be foreign to our
subject, and I will only call your attention in passing to
one or two points which have a special bearing upon the
general nature of the enzymes. Take, for example, the
influence of such substances as urethan, paraldehyde, and
thallin sulphate on the proteolytic action of pepsin-hydrochloric
<span class="nowrap">acid<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></span> and we find that small quantities, 0.1 to
0.3 per cent. tend to increase the rate of proteolysis, while
larger amounts, say one per cent., decidedly check proteolysis.
Similarly, among inorganic compounds, arsenious
oxide, arsenic oxide, boracic acid, and potassium <span class="nowrap">bromide<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></span>
in small amounts increase the proteolytic power of pepsin
in hydrochloric acid solution, while larger quantities check
the action of the ferment in proportion to the amounts
added. Again, with the enzyme trypsin, similar results
with such salts as potassium cyanide, sodium tetraborate,
potassium bromide and <span class="nowrap">iodide<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></span> may be quoted as showing<span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span>
not only the sensitiveness of the ferment toward foreign
substances, but likewise its peculiar behavior, viz., stimulation
in the presence of small amounts and inhibition in the
presence of larger quantities.</p>

<p>Furthermore, we have found that even gases, as carbonic
acid and hydrogen sulphide, exert a marked retarding
influence on the proteid-digesting power of trypsin.
Moreover, while it is generally stated that proteolytic and
other enzymes are practically indifferent to the presence of
chloroform, thymol, and other like substances that quickly
interfere with the processes of the so-called organized
ferments, pepsin and trypsin certainly do show a certain
degree of sensitiveness to chloroform, and indeed even to a
current of air passed through their solutions. Thus, very
recently, <span class="nowrap">Bertels<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></span> and <span class="nowrap">Dubs<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></span>, working under Salkowski’s
direction, have called attention to the peculiar behavior of
pepsin to chloroform; their results showing, first, that
small amounts of this agent tend to increase the proteolytic
power of the enzyme, while larger amounts decrease its
digestive power. Another interesting point brought out
especially by Dub’s experiments is the fact that an impure
solution of the ferment, viz., an acid extract, for example,
of the mucous membrane of the stomach containing more
or less albuminous matter, is far less sensitive to chloroform
than an acid solution of the purified ferment, thus
showing again the protective influence of proteids and
other extraneous matters; the latter guarding the enzyme
to a certain extent from both the stimulating and inhibitory
action of various agents.</p>

<p>Another point to be emphasized just here is that any
chemical substance, such as a metallic salt, having a spe<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>cific
action upon proteid matter, will almost invariably
interfere more or less with the proteolytic action of these
enzymes, both through a direct action upon the soluble
ferment itself, and also through an indirect action in modifying
or inhibiting the digestibility of the proteid exposed
to proteolysis. All of these facts emphasize more or less
the proteid-like nature of the enzymes, or at least the
carriers of the ferments. It is further very suggestive
that the destruction of these enzymes by heat happens to
occur at approximately those temperatures which are generally
recognized as the coagulation points of ordinary
proteids. Moreover, the apparent lack of stability so
characteristic of these ferments, their inherent proneness
to alteration, their marked susceptibility to every change
in environment, all point to large complex molecules, such
as we have in proteids and are familiar with in living
protoplasm.</p>

<p>Whatever the exact nature of these proteolytic enzymes,
they are certainly endowed with the power of transforming
relatively large amounts of proteid matter into soluble
products, even though they themselves are present in very
small quantity. They are derived, as we have seen, from
living protoplasmic cells, and we might perhaps, with
v. <span class="nowrap">Nägeli<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></span> and Mayer<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></span> consider them as retaining a portion
of that molecular motion so characteristic of living
protoplasm, by which the equilibrium of the dead food-proteid
may be disturbed and thus changes started which
result in what we call proteolysis. However this may be,
we must look to some phase of catalytic or contact action
as the true explanation of this power of proteolysis. At
first glance, any explanation or theory involving the use of
catalysis seems exceedingly vague and indefinite, and yet<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
many illustrations can be given of chemical reactions
where the dominating agent evidently acts in this manner.
“We call a force catalytic,” says the philosopher of
Heilbron, “when it holds no communicable proportion to
the assumed results of its action. An avalanche is hurled
into the valley<span class="ell">...</span>. A puff of wind or the fluttering of a
bird’s wing is the catalytic force which has given the
signal for, and which is the cause of the wide-spread
disaster.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></span> In the older theories of catalytic action, the
catalytic agent was supposed to remain passive, but not so
in the more modern conception of catalysis. The ferment
by its presence makes possible certain changes and combinations
which could not occur in its absence, at least under
the existing circumstances, although all the other conditions
might be favorable. The proteids, for example, have
a natural tendency to undergo hydration; thus, simple
boiling with dilute acid or exposure to the action of superheated
water alone<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></span> will produce many if not all of the
products formed in natural digestive proteolysis. To be
sure, they are not formed as readily as in artificial or
natural digestion, and there may be some minor points of
difference, but still proteolysis can be imitated in this
manner. The proteolytic enzymes simply help on this
natural tendency of proteid bodies to undergo hydration,
and by their presence and action enable it to occur at
lower temperatures than it otherwise could, and at the
same time render it more rapid and complete. This is not
accomplished, however, by simple contact. The enzymes,
we may assume, combine in some manner with the proteid
undergoing digestion, starting thereby a train of reactions<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
in which the proteid and the water present are the main
actors, they being, however, perfectly passive in the
absence of the inciting agent, the enzyme. As expressed
by Ganger, “the ferment phenomena resemble those in
which there is apparently a periodic synthesis and dissociation
of the catalyzing agent, which acts in a similar manner
to the agent which explodes a train of gunpowder.”</p>

<p>We can find many illustrations among chemical phenomena
where one body, even though present in small quantity,
acts as a go-between and makes possible an almost indefinite
exchange of matter and energy. Take as an illustration,
the part played by water in determining the explosion
of oxygen and carbon-monoxide gas. Some years ago,
<span class="nowrap">Dixon<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></span> called attention to the fact that a mixture of these
two gases when perfectly dry would not explode even by
contact with red hot platinum wire. The presence, however,
of a small amount of aqueous vapor would at once
cause an explosion to occur. In confirmation of this observation,
<span class="nowrap">Traube<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></span> has reported that a flame of carbon-monoxide
gas introduced into a perfectly dry atmosphere
is at once extinguished. In a moist atmosphere, on the
other hand, the flame will continue to burn indefinitely,
that is as long as the CO gas is supplied. In these cases,
the water, which is so necessary for the appearance of the
reaction, and which furnishes a striking illustration of the
action of a contact or catalytic substance is not purely
passive. To be sure, only a minimal amount is necessary
for the combustion of an indefinite amount of carbonic
oxide, but the water enters into the reaction itself. It is
to be noticed that carbonic oxide and water alone, even at
high temperatures, will not react, but in the presence of<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
oxygen the water is decomposed with formation of hydrogen-peroxide,
thus:</p>

<p class="tac">
CO + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O + O<sub>2</sub> = CO(OH)<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>

<p>The hydrogen-peroxide thus formed combines with
carbonic oxide to form carbonic acid, which in turn is
decomposed into the anhydride CO<sub>2</sub>, with regeneration of
water, the latter being available for further action of the
same order:</p>

<p class="tac">
H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + CO = CO(OH)<sub>2</sub><br />
2 CO(OH)<sub>2</sub> = 2 CO<sub>2</sub> + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>

<p>Indeed, as can be readily seen from the equations, this
may be kept up indefinitely, a small amount of water, <i>i.e.</i>,
the go-between, the catalytic agent, sufficing to accomplish
the transformation of almost any amount of carbon-monoxide.
This, I think, furnishes an excellent illustration
of the way in which catalytic agents, such as the
proteolytic enzymes, may be supposed to act. It is truly
contact action, but the agent is not purely passive; the
enzyme combines with the substance undergoing proteolysis,
and the resultant compound thus formed is enabled
now to combine with water and undergo hydrolysis, something
which could not be accomplished by the proteid and
water alone, that is at body temperature. This new and
more complex compound is naturally less stable and soon
undergoes dissociation or cleavage with a splitting off of
the original enzyme for one product, which is thus available
for further action of the same order; while, as other
products, we find the hydrated and otherwise altered substances
coming from the proteid, and whose formation is
the ultimate object of the whole process.</p>

<p>The parallelism between this hypothetical action of the
proteolytic enzymes and the known reactions in the above
combustion of carbonic oxide is certainly very close, and<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
leaves little doubt that this explanation of enzyme action
is, in a general way at least, correct. Thus the carbonic
oxide, CO, brought in contact with pure, dry oxygen gas
(apparently all that is necessary for its direct oxidation into
carbonic acid, CO<sub>2</sub>), undergoes no change; the burning CO
gas is at once extinguished. Evidently, something more is
necessary in order to start the process of oxidation. So,
too, in proteolysis; the process, as we shall see later on, is
essentially one of hydration, but bring the proteid and the
water, or acid-water, together and although all the conditions
are apparently favorable for hydration there is, as
you know, little or no change. But introduce the catalytic
agent and immediately the reaction commences. In the
case of the burning CO gas in contact with oxygen, the
water acting as contact agent makes oxidation possible,
enabling the main actors in the transformation to react
upon each other. But, as we have seen, the contact agent
is something more than a mere looker-on, it becomes for
the time being an integral part of the molecule, undergoing
change, combining with it and thus making possible the
subsequent alterations characteristic of the specific transformation,
in which, however, the regeneration of the
contact agent is a prominent feature. So, too, with the
proteolytic enzymes, pepsin and trypsin, they are the go-betweens,
making possible the union of the proteids with
water by combining with the proteid molecule and thus
paving the way for both hydration and cleavage. In the
cleavage of the complex molecule, we have the regeneration
of the ferment as a prominent feature, and in proteolysis
we understand that the regenerated ferment may act
not only upon more of the original proteid, but likewise
upon the primary products of its action, thus giving rise
eventually to a row of more or less closely related cleavage
products. Finally, we can conceive that the enzyme may<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
gradually be affected by the process, that its regeneration
may become less complete, and thus digestive power be
eventually diminished.</p>

<p>Much more might be said in support of the above
hypothesis. On the other hand, some objections might be
raised against it, but I know of no more reasonable explanation
of enzyme action than that here presented, or one
which so well accords with all of the known facts concerning
the conditions which modify proteolytic action<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></span> Thus,
the influence of heat, of the products of proteolysis, of
acids, alkalies, and various organic and inorganic salts on
the action of these digestive enzymes is such as lends favor
to the above view rather than opposes it.</p>


<h4>THE GENERAL NATURE OF PROTEIDS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Proteids</span> are confessedly among the most complex
bodies the physiologist has to deal with, while at the same
time they are perhaps the most important, not only in
view of their wide-spread distribution through animal and
vegetable tissues, but because of the prominent part they
take in the nutrition of the body. The more our knowledge
is broadened concerning these varied substances, the
more we are impressed with their complexity, and at the
same time with the necessity for a more accurate study of
both their composition and constitution. Concerning the
latter, full fruition of our hopes is probably in the distant
future, but every step of advance in this direction adds
greatly to our resources in the interpretation of the varied
and complex changes characteristic of proteid metabolism.<span class="pagenum" title="28"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a></span>
Every study of proteid decomposition adds something to
our store of knowledge, and gives perhaps an added fact
available for broadening our deductions<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></span> Moreover, the
composition and general reactions of the proteids may be
investigated with full confidence of obtaining many useful
results, which must necessarily be an aid in interpreting
the changes accompanying digestive proteolysis.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the single question of peptonization
by gastric digestion. What is the nature of the process?
Is the proteid transformed into a soluble and diffusible
peptone as a result of hydration and cleavage, or is it a
transformation which results from a simple depolymeriza­tion
of the proteid molecule, <i>i.e.</i>, are we to consider
albumin and peptone as isomeric bodies? These questions,
on which physiologists seem loath to agree, can certainly
be answered definitely; not, however, by arguments but by
careful experimenta­tion, in which the composition of the
proteid undergoing digestion must be a necessary preliminary
factor, and the composition of the resultant product,
or products, a secondary factor of equal importance.
Further, the question needs to be answered not with
reference to one proteid merely, but with reference to
every proteid capable of digestion by either gastric or
pancreatic juice. When these questions have been fully
answered in this manner, we shall have positive data to
deal with, and our conclusions will rest upon a foundation
of fact not easily set aside. This is one of the problems
upon which I have been at work for some years, and
although progress may in one sense be slow, yet it is sure
and gives results of no uncertain character.</p>

<p>First, then, let us consider briefly the nature of the proteids
whose proteolysis we may be interested in; remem<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>bering,
however, that in so doing we can merely touch
upon the points essential for our purpose. Allow me to
say in parenthesis that there is being published in Moscow
a work on proteids alone of five volumes, 900 pages each,
which it is supposed will constitute an exhaustive treatise
of the subject<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">50</a></span></p>

<p>If we attempt to classify all of the proteid bodies
hitherto discovered and studied we are at once confronted
with a problem of no small proportions. So varied are
they in their reactions, solubilities, and behavior toward
general reagents, so inclined to merge into each other by
almost insensible gradations that it becomes an extremely
difficult matter to make an arrangement that will satisfy all
the requirements of the case. I have to suggest, however,
the following classification, which is merely a modification
of several existing ones, based primarily upon chemical
composition, and solubility in the more common
menstruums.</p>

<p>Proteids may first be divided into three main groups as
follows:</p>

<p>I. <i>Simple Proteids.</i>&mdash;Composed of carbon, hydrogen,
nitrogen, sulphur, and oxygen, and yielding by decomposition
aromatic bodies such as tyrosin, phenol, indol, etc.</p>

<p>II. <i>Compound Proteids.</i>&mdash;Composed of a simple proteid
united to some non-proteid body.</p>

<p>III. <i>Albuminoids.</i>&mdash;A class of nitrogenous bodies
related to and derived from proteids, but differing especially
from the latter by great resistance to the ordinary
solvents of true proteids.</p>

<p>The individual members of these three groups may be
arranged as follows on the basis of solubility, coagulability,
etc.:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="30"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a></span></p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Simple Proteids.</span>&mdash;<i>A.</i> <i>Soluble in water.</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i> Coagulable
by heat, and by long contact with alcohol.
Albumins: serum-albumin, egg-albumin, lacto-albumin,
myo-albumin, vegetable albumins. <i>b.</i> Non-coagulable by
heat and by long contact with alcohol. Proteoses<span class="nowrap">:<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> protoproteoses,
deutero­proteoses. Peptones<span class="nowrap">:<a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></span> amphopeptones,
antipeptones, hemipeptones.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> <i>Insoluble in water, but soluble in salt solutions.</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i>
More or less coagulable by heat. Globulins. 1. Soluble
in dilute and saturated NaCl solutions. Vitellins. 2.
Soluble in dilute NaCl solutions, but precipitated by
saturation with NaCl. Myosins, <span class="nowrap">paraglobulin<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">52</a></span> or serum-globulin,
fibrinogen, myo-globulin, paramyosinogen, cell-globulins.
<i>b.</i> Non-coagulable by heat, soluble in dilute
NaCl solution and precipitated by saturation with NaCl.
Hetero­proteoses.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> <i>Insoluble in water and salt solutions, soluble in

<p><i>D.</i> <i>Insoluble in water, salt solutions and alcohol;
soluble in dilute acids or alkalies.</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i> Coagulable by heat
when suspended in a neutral fluid. Acid-albumins, alkali-albumins
or albuminates. <i>b.</i> Non-coagulable by heat when
suspended in a neutral fluid. Antialbumids, dysproteoses,
glutenins.</p>

<p><i>E.</i> <i>Insoluble in water, salt solutions, alcohol, dilute
acids and alkalies; soluble in strong acids, alkalies, and
in pepsin-hydrochloric acid and alkaline solutions of
trypsin.</i>&mdash;Coagulated proteids, fibrin<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></span></p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span></p>
<p>II. <span class="smcap">Compound Proteids.</span>&mdash;<i>A.</i> <i>Compounds of a proteid
(globulin) with an iron-containing pigment, soluble in
water and coagulable by heat and alcohol.</i> Hæmoglobin,
oxyhæmoglobin, methæmoglobin, etc.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> <i>Compounds of proteids with members of the carbohydrate
group. Insoluble in water; soluble in very weak
alkalies.</i>&mdash;<i>a.</i> True mucins. <i>b.</i> Mucoids or mucinoids.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> <i>Compounds of proteids with nucleic acid. Phosphorized
bodies yielding by decomposition metaphosphoric
acid. Insoluble in water and in pepsin-hydrochloric
acid, but more or less soluble in alkalies.</i>&mdash;Nucleins.</p>

<p><i>D.</i> <i>Compounds of proteids with nucleins. Very soluble
in dilute alkalies.</i>&mdash;Nucleoalbumins, as casein of milk, and
nucleoalbumins of cell-protoplasm and cell-nuclei, etc.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Albuminoids.</span>&mdash;<i>A.</i> <i>Soluble in boiling water with
formation of gelatin and yielding by decomposition leucin
and glycocoll.</i>&mdash;Collagen (gelatin).</p>

<p><i>B.</i> <i>Insoluble in boiling water, and yielding by decomposition
much leucin and some tyrosin, together with glycocoll
and lysatin. Slowly hydrated by boiling dilute acids
and by treatment with pepsin-hydrochloric acid.</i>&mdash;Elastin.</p>

<p><i>C.</i> <i>Insoluble in water, dilute acids and alkalies, also
in gastric and pancreatic juice. Yield leucin and tyrosin
by decomposition.</i>&mdash;Keratin, neurokeratin.</p>

<p>We may now advantageously consider the composition
of a few of the more prominent represen­ta­tives of the
individual groups, taking for illustration those bodies
which have been most thoroughly studied, and which we
may have occasion to refer to in our discussion of proteolysis.
I have not included in the table any of the
alteration-products of the proteids formed by the action of
pepsin-acid, trypsin, or boiling dilute acids, confining
myself here simply to those bodies which occur ready-formed
in nature.</p>

<p class="tac fs80">* Many of these results represent the average of a large number of individual analyses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span></p>

<p>In considering the results tabulated above, it is to be
remembered that all of these bodies, with the exception of
keratin, neurokeratin, and reticulin, are more or less
digestible in either gastric or pancreatic juice, or indeed in
both fluids. I will not take time here to point out the
obvious genetic relationships and differences in composition
shown by the above data, but will immediately call your
attention to the fact that there are other and more important
points of difference between many of these proteids
which are hidden beneath the surface, and which a simple
determination of composition will not bring to light. I
refer to the chemical constitution of the bodies, to the way
in which the individual atoms are arranged in the molecule,
on which hinges more or less the general properties of the
bodies and which in part determines their behavior
toward the digestive enzymes, as well as toward other
hydrolytic agents. These differences in inner structure
can only be ascertained by a study of the decomposition
products of the proteids, and of the way in which the complex
molecules break down into simpler. The nature of
the fragments resulting from the decomposition of a complex
proteid molecule, gives at once something of an
insight into the character of the molecule. Thus, egg-albumin
exposed to the action of boiling dilute sulphuric
acid yields, among other fragments, large quantities of
leucin and tyrosin, the latter belonging to the aromatic
group and containing the phenyl radical. Collagen, or
gelatin, on the other hand, by similar treatment fails to
yield any tyrosin or related aromatic body, but gives instead
glycocoll or amido-acetic acid, in addition to leucin, lysin,
and other products common to albumin. Its constitution,
therefore, is evidently quite different from that of albumin,
but the composition of the body reveals no sign of it.
Further, we have physiological evidence of this difference<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
in constitution in that gelatin, though containing even
more nitrogen than albumin, is not able to take the place
of the latter in supplying the physiological needs of the
body; its food-value is of quite a different order from that
of albumin.</p>

<p>But while all of the individual proteids show many
points of difference, either in composition, constitution,
reactions, or otherwise, they are nearly all alike in their
tendency to undergo hydrolytic decomposition under
proper conditions; the extent of the hydrolysis and
accompanying cleavage being dependent simply upon the
vigor or duration of the hydrolytic process.</p>

<p>Furthermore, all of the simple proteids, at least, give
evidence of the presence of two distinct groups or radicals,
which give rise by decomposition or cleavage to two distinct
classes of products. These two groups, which we
may assume to be characteristic of every typical proteid,
Kühne has named the anti- and hemi-group respectively.
This conception of the proteid molecule is one of the
foundation-stones on which rest some of our present theories
regarding the hydrolytic decomposition of proteids,
especially by the proteolytic enzymes. Moreover, it is not
a mere conception, for it has been tested so many times by
experiment that it has seemingly become a fact. The two
groups, or their represen­ta­tives, can be separated, in part,
at least, by the action of dilute sulphuric acid (three per
cent.) at 100°&nbsp;C. Thus, after a few hours’ treatment of
coagulated egg-albumin, about fifty per cent. of the proteid
passes into solution, while there remains a homogeneous
mass, something like silica in appearance, insoluble in
dilute acid, but readily soluble in dilute solutions of sodium
carbonate. This latter is the representative of the anti-group,
originally named by <span class="nowrap">Schützenberger<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></span> hemiprotein,<span class="pagenum" title="35"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a></span>
but now called antialbumid<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></span> It is only slightly digestible
in gastric juice, but is readily attacked by alkaline solutions
of trypsin, being converted thereby into a soluble peptone
known as antipeptone. In the sulphuric acid solution, on
the other hand, are found the represen­ta­tives of the hemi-group;
viz., albumoses, originally known as one body,
hemialbumose<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></span> together with more or less hemipeptone,
leucin, tyrosin, etc.</p>

<p>The fact that we have so many represen­ta­tives of the
hemi-group in this decomposition is significant of the
readiness with which the so-called hemi-group undergoes
change. All of its members are prone to suffer hydration
and cleavage, passing through successive stages until
leucin, tyrosin, and other simple bodies are reached.
These, and other similar crystalline bodies, are likewise the
typical end-products of proteolysis by trypsin, and presumably
come directly from the breaking-down of hemipeptone.
Antipeptone, on the other hand, is incapable of
further change by the proteolytic ferment trypsin. Hence,
the hemi-group can be identified by the behavior of the
body containing it toward trypsin; <i>i.e.</i>, it will ultimately
yield leucin, tyrosin, and other bodies of simple constitution
to be spoken of later on. The anti-group, however,
will show its presence by a certain degree of resistance to
the action of trypsin, antipeptone being the final product
of its transformation by this agent; <i>i.e.</i>, leucin, tyrosin,
etc., will not result. In this hydrolytic cleavage of proteids
the anti-group does not always appear as antialbumid.
It may make its appearance in the form of some related
body, the exact character of the product being dependent<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
in great part upon the nature of the hydrolytic agent, but
in every case the character­istics of the anti-group will
come to the surface when the body is subjected to the
action of trypsin.</p>

<p>The above-described treatment of a coagulated proteid
with water containing sulphuric acid evidently induces
profound changes in the proteid molecule. The conditions
are certainly such as favor hydration, and in the case of
complex molecules, like the proteids, cleavage might naturally
be expected to follow. Analysis of antialbumid
from various sources plainly shows that its formation is
accompanied by marked chemical changes. Thus, the
following data, showing the composition of antialbumid
formed from egg-albumin and serum-albumin by the action
of dilute sulphuric acid at 100°&nbsp;C., gives tangible expression
to the extent of this change:</p>

</table></div>

<p>In both cases there is a noticeable decrease in nitrogen,
and a corresponding increase in the content of carbon.
Evidently, then, this cleavage of the albumin-molecule
into the anti-group on the one hand, and into bodies of the
hemi-group on the other, is accompanied by chemical
changes of such magnitude that their imprint is plainly
visible upon the resultant products; changes which
certainly are far removed from those common to
polymerization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="37"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a></span></p>

<p>This proneness of proteid matter to undergo hydration
and subsequent cleavage is further testified to by the
readiness with which even such a resistant body as coagulated
egg-albumin breaks down under the simple influence
of superheated water at 130° to 150°&nbsp;C. Many
observations are recorded bearing on this tendency of
proteid matter, but few observers have carried their experiments
to a satisfactory conclusion. A recent study of this
question in my own laboratory, has given some very interesting
results<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></span> Thus, coagulated egg-albumin placed in
sealed tubes with a little distilled water and exposed to a
temperature of 150°&nbsp;C. for three to four hours, rapidly
dissolves, leaving, however, an appreciable residue. The
solution reacts alkaline, there is a separation of sulphur,
and in the fluid is to be found not albumin, but two distinct
albumose-like bodies, together with some true peptone,
and a small amount of leucin, tyrosin, and presumably
other bodies<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">89</a></span> The albumose-like bodies are in many ways
quite peculiar. In some respects they resemble the albumoses
formed in ordinary digestion; but in others they
show peculiarities which render them quite unique, so that
they merit the specific name of atmidalbumoses, as suggested
by Neumeister. What, however, I wish to call
attention to here is the composition of these albumoses.
Prepared from coagulated egg-albumin by the simple
action of heat and water, they show a deviation from the
composition of the mother-proteid, which plainly implies
changes of no slight degree. This is clearly apparent from
the following table:</p>

<p>Here we see that two of these primary albumoses formed
by the action of superheated water, like the previously
described antialbumid, show a loss of nitrogen with a
marked increase in the content of carbon. Evidently, they
are related to the antialbumid formed by the action of
dilute acid. They are, however, soluble in water, and in
many ways differ from true antialbumid, but there is evidently
an inner relationship. The so-called deutero­atmidalbumose
shows a still more noticeable falling off in
nitrogen and sulphur, while the content of carbon is more
closely allied to that of the mother-proteid. The albumose
precipitable by sodium chloride, although different from
an albumid, evidently comes from the anti-group and is a
cleavage product which in turn may undergo further
hydration and splitting by continued treatment. The
so-called deutero-body, on the other hand, may well be a
representative of the hemi-group<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></span></p>

<p>It is not my purpose here to enter into details connected
with the action of superheated water on proteids. Such a
course would take us too far from our present subject, but
I do wish to emphasize the fact that even the most resistant
of proteids has an innate tendency to undergo hydration
and cleavage, and that even simple heating with water
alone, at a temperature slightly above 100°&nbsp;C., is sufficient<span class="pagenum" title="39"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a></span>
to induce at least partial solution of the proteid. Further,
this solvent action in the case of water and dilute acids, at
least, is certainly associated with marked chemical changes.
It is not mere solution, it is not simply the formation of
one soluble body, but solution of the proteid is accompanied
by the appearance of a row of new products, in which
the terminal bodies are crystalline substances of simple
composition. Further, this conclusion does not rest upon
the results obtained from a single proteid, for I have at
various times studied also the primary products formed in
the cleavage of casein, elastin, zein, and other proteids by
the action of hot dilute acid, and in all cases have obtained
evidence of the formation of several proteose-like bodies,
as well as of true peptones.</p>

<p>By the action of more powerful hydrolytic agents, such
as boiling hydrochloric acid to which a little stannous
chloride has been added to prevent oxidation, the proteid
molecule may be completely broken down into simple
decomposition products, of which leucin, tyrosin, aspartic
acid, glutamic acid, glucoprotein, lysin, and lysatinin are
typical examples<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span> In other words, by this and other
methods of treatment, which we cannot take time to consider,
we can easily break down the albumin-molecule
completely into bodies which, as we shall see later on, are
typical end-products of trypsin-proteolysis, and which are
far removed from the original proteid. But, as we have
seen, even the primary bodies formed in the less profound
hydrolysis induced by superheated water, do not show the
composition of the mother-proteid. Hydration and cleavage
leave their marks upon the products, and thereby we
know that solution of the proteid is the result of something
more than a mere rearrangement of the atoms in
the molecule.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="40"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a></span></p>
<p>Further, we are to remember that boiling dilute acid
and superheated water tend to produce a cleavage along
specific lines; viz., a cleavage into the anti- and hemi-groups
of the molecule, and as represen­ta­tives of these
groups we may, in the hydration of every native proteid,
look for two distinct rows of closely related substances.</p>

<p>In digestive proteolysis it will be our purpose to show
that cleavage of much the same order occurs, not necessarily
resulting, however, in the formation of identically the
same products, but certainly accompanied with the production
of bodies belonging to the hemi- and anti-groups,
although they may be less sharply separated from each
other than in the cleavage with dilute sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>The body originally described as hemialbumose, and
identified as a product of every gastric digestion, is now
known to be a mixture of closely related substances ordinarily
spoken of as albumoses<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span> or generically as proteoses.
These are primary products in the digestion of every form
of proteid matter, intermediate between the mother-proteid
and the peptone which results from the further action of the
proteolytic enzymes. Associated with the hemialbumoses
are corresponding antialbumoses, coming from the anti-half
of the proteid molecule, and differing from their
neighbors, the hemi-bodies, mainly in their behavior
toward the ferment trypsin. Thus, we have the counterpart
of the many bodies described by Meissner, although
now arranged systematically and on the basis of structural
and other differences not thought of in his day.</p>

<p>By the initial action of pepsin-acid, proteids are first
transformed into acid-albumin or syntonin, then, by the
further action of the ferment, this body is changed into
the primary proteoses, proto and heteroproteose, of each of
which there must be two varieties, a hemi and an anti.<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
These may then undergo further transformation into what
is known as a secondary proteose, viz., deutero­proteose, of
which there must likewise be two varieties, corresponding
to the hemi- and anti-groups respectively. By continued
proteolytic action there results as the final product of
gastric digestion peptones; approximately, an equal mixture
of so-called hemipeptone and antipeptone, generally
known as amphopeptone. Such a peptone exposed to the
proteolytic action of trypsin should obviously break down
in part into simple crystalline bodies, leaving a residue of
true antipeptone. In truth, this is exactly what does happen
when the peptone resulting from gastric digestion is
warmed with an alkaline solution of trypsin. The so-called
hemipeptone quickly responds to the action of the pancreatic
ferment, and is converted into other products, while
the so-called antipeptone resists its action completely, thus
giving results in harmony with our general conception of
the proteid molecule.</p>

<p>On the basis of these facts, and others not yet mentioned,
we may accept provisionally, at least, the above
schematic view, suggested in part by Neumeister<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></span> of the<span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
general line of proteolysis as it occurs in pepsin-digestion;
a view which clearly expresses the significant relationship
of the hemi- and anti-groups in the proteid molecule.</p>

<p>The dark and light lines in this scheme are intended to
represent the relative share which the hemi- and anti-groups
take in the formation of the individual bodies.
Thus, we see that proto­proteoses have their origin mainly
in the hemi-groups of the molecule, although, as the fine
line indicates, anti-groups are somewhat concerned in their
construction. Hetero­proteoses, on the other hand, come
mainly from the anti-groups, but still some hemi-groups
have a part in their structure. As previously stated, these
two primary proteoses by further hydrolytic action may be
transformed into secondary products; viz., into deutero­proteoses,
but, as the above scheme indicates, the two
deutero bodies will be more or less unlike in their inner
nature. In one sense, they are both ampho­deutero­proteoses,
but they necessarily differ in the proportion of
hemi- and anti-groups they contain. By the still further
action of pepsin-acid, the deutero bodies may be changed,
in part at least, into peptone, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, into amphopeptone,
although, as Neumeister has pointed out, protoproteose
tends to yield an amphopeptone in which the hemi-groups
predominate, while the peptone coming from heteroproteose
contains an excess of anti-groups. Moreover, in the
gastric digestion of any simple proteid a certain number of
anti-groups are split off in the form of antialbumid, a body
which is only slowly digestible in pepsin-acid. By the
very powerful proteolytic action of a strong gastric juice,
however, antialbumid may be somewhat digested, and is
then transformed into anti­deutero­albumose, which in turn
may be eventually changed into antipeptone.</p>

<p>From these statements it is evident that a given proteid
exposed to pepsin-proteolysis may give rise to a large<span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
number of products; in fact, to a far larger number than
is implied by the names in the above scheme. Thus, at
first glance you would be inclined to say there can be only
three deutero­albumoses, for example; one, a pure antibody,
the other two, ampho­albumoses, differing from each
other simply in their content of hemi- and anti-groups. It
must be remembered, however, that the inner constitution
of these bodies, as implied by the relative proportion of
the above groups, may vary to almost any extent. Thus,
every variation in the number of anti-groups split off from
the original albumin molecule to form antialbumid means
just so much of a change in the relative proportion of
hemi- and anti-groups entering into the structure of both
primary and secondary albumoses. Hence, as you can see,
digestive proteolysis, even in gastric digestion, is a somewhat
complex process. We have to deal not only with a
number of bodies superficially unlike, as the primary and
secondary proteoses and peptones, but these bodies may
show marked variations in structure dependent upon the
exact conditions attending their formation.</p>

<p>Evidently, the complexities attending digestive proteolysis
are connected primarily with the complex nature of
the proteids themselves, while proteolysis, as a process, is
made possible through the natural tendency of the proteids
to undergo hydration and cleavage.</p>

<h2>LECTURE II.</h2>

<h3>PROTEOLYSIS BY PEPSIN-HYDROCHLORIC ACID, WITH A CONSIDERATION
OF THE GENERAL NATURE OF
PROTEOSES AND PEPTONES.</h3>


<h4>PROTEOLYSIS BY PEPSIN-ACID.</h4>

<p>Gastric digestion is essentially an acid digestion. As a
proteolytic agent, pepsin can act only in the presence of
acid, and we have every reason for believing that the
enzyme and the acid form a compound, which in turn combines
with the proteid undergoing digestion; or, what
amounts to much the same thing, that the acid perhaps
forms first a compound with the proteid, to which the pepsin
can then unite to form a still more complex compound
capable of undergoing hydration and cleavage. Pepsin-proteolysis,
therefore, is strictly the proteolysis produced
by pepsin-acid. In view of this fact, we may well give a
moment’s thought to the nature and origin of this acid.</p>

<p>Without attempting any statement of the gradual development
of our knowledge regarding the acid of the gastric
juice, we may accept the now well-established fact that the
acid is hydrochloric acid, and that it has its origin in the
parietal, or so-called border-cells of the gastric glands.
That the acid is derived from the decomposition of chlorides
is practically self-evident, but <span class="nowrap">Cahn<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></span> has added experimental
proof which removes all shadow of doubt, through
his study of the gastric secretion in animals deprived for
many days of salt; the gastric juice in such cases being perfectly
neutral in reaction, but normal as regards its content
of pepsin.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span></p>
<p>The way in which the specific gland-cells manufacture
free hydrochloric acid out of material contained in an alkaline
medium is somewhat doubtful. There are, however,
at the present day two theories worthy of special notice.
The first is based upon observations made by <span class="nowrap">Maly<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></span> many
years ago, which tend to show that certain mineral salts
present in the blood are capable of reacting upon each
other with formation of hydrochloric acid. Thus, while
the blood is an alkaline fluid, it really owes its alkalinity to
the presence of two acid salts, viz., sodium bicarbonate
(HNaCO<sub>3</sub>) and disodium hydrogen phosphate (HNa<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>).
This latter compound, acted upon by the carbonic acid of
the blood, is transformed into a dihydrogen sodium phosphate
with simultaneous formation of acid sodium carbonate,
as shown in the following equation:</p>

<p class="tac">
Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O = NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + HNaCO<sub>3</sub>.<br />
</p>

<p>This acid sodium phosphate dissolved in a fluid containing
sodium chloride, gives rise to free hydrochloric acid by a
very simple reaction:</p>

<p class="tac">
NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> + NaCl = Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> + HCl.<br />
</p>

<p>It is also to be noted that the disodium hydrogen phosphate,
may, likewise, give rise to hydrochloric acid through
its action on calcium chloride, as indicated by the following
equation:</p>

<p class="tac">
2Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub> + 3CaCl<sub>2</sub> = Ca<sub>3</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 4NaCl + 2HCl.<br />
</p>

<p>It is thus evident that hydrochloric acid may originate
in the inter-reaction of these several salts which are known
to be present in the blood; but obviously, the above reactions
cannot take place in the blood itself, and we must
look to the selective power of the epithelial cells of the
gastric glands, as suggested by Gamgee<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></span> for the with<span class="pagenum" title="46"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a></span>drawal
of the needed salts from the blood. Once present
in the acid-forming cells, and perhaps aided by the inherent
qualities of the protoplasm, the necessary chemical
reactions may be assumed to take place, after which the
newly formed acid may pass from the gland-cells into the
secretion of the gland.</p>

<p>A later theory regarding the formation of the acid of the
gastric juice emanates from Liebermann<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span> This investigator
claims the existence in the mucous membrane of the
stomach of an acid-reacting, nuclein-like body, which is
apparently a combination of the phosphorized substance
lecithin with a proteid. To this compound body Liebermann
gives the name of lecithalbumin. It is apparently
located in the nuclei of the gastric cells, is strongly acid in
reaction, and, according to Liebermann, is an important
agent in the production of the free hydrochloric acid of the
gastric juice, although its action is somewhat indirect.
According to this theory, the free acid is formed in the
mucous membrane of the stomach from sodium chloride,
through the dissociating action of the carbonic acid coming
from normal oxidation. The thus-formed acid then diffuses
in both directions, viz., through the lumen of the gland
into the stomach-cavity, and in part in the opposite direction
into the veins and lymphatics. It is the assumed
function of the lecithalbumin to react with the alkaline
sodium carbonate, produced simultaneously with the hydrochloric
acid. This naturally gives rise to the liberation of
carbonic acid and to the formation of a non-diffusible
sodium-lecithalbumin compound, which is retained for the
time being in the body of the cell. When the circulation
of the blood, accelerated by the digestive process, returns
to its ordinary pace, this latter compound is slowly decom<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>posed
by the carbonic acid with formation of the readily
diffusible sodium carbonate, which passes into the blood-current.
The rate of this latter reaction is impeded, or,
perhaps regulated, by the swelling up of the lecithalbumin-containing
cells, thus rendering the imbibition of the
carbonic acid a slow process. The rate of production of
the hydrochloric acid by this hypothetical process depends
primarily upon the blood supply, and the oxidative changes
by which carbonic acid is formed.</p>

<p>There is much that might be said for and against this
theory<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></span> but we cannot stop to discuss it here. Like the
previous theory, it implies the production of hydrochloric
acid from a chloride or chlorides, through chemical processes
taking place in the stomach-mucosa, and presumably
in the large border-cells of the peptic glands. This hydrochloric
acid, as you know, in the act of secretion, reacts
upon the pepsinogen with which it may come in contact,
transforming it into pepsin. It also has the power of combining
with all forms of proteid matter, not excepting the
products of proteolytic action, to form acid compounds in
which the so-combined acid, although equal quantitatively
to the original amount of free acid, is less active in many
ways. Thus, it does not possess in the same degree a
destructive action on the amylolytic ferments<span class="nowrap">;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></span> it does not
play the same part in aiding the proteolytic action of pepsin,
and its antiseptic power is far from equal to that of a
like amount of free acid<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></span></p>

<p>With relatively large amounts of proteid, we may have
half or even quarter saturated proteid molecules, in which<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
the weakness of the combined acid is far more pronounced
than in the case of the fully saturated molecule. Such a
condition of things must obviously exist in the early
stages of gastric digestion. With an excess of proteid
matter in the stomach, some time must elapse before the
secretion of hydrochloric acid will be sufficient to furnish
acid for all of the proteid matter present, yet pepsin-proteolysis
does not wait the appearance of free acid. Indeed,
the proteid matter may not have combined with more than
half its complement of hydrochloric acid before digestive
proteolysis is well under way. I have made many analyses
of the stomach-contents after test meals, and under
other conditions, where no free acid could be detected by
the tropaeolin test, or better, by Günzburg’s reagent (phloroglucin-vanillin),
although phenol­phthalein as well as litmus
showed strong acid reaction, and yet not only could
acid-albumin be detected in the filtered fluid, but likewise
proteoses and peptones. In other words, pepsin-proteolysis
can proceed in the absence of free hydrochloric acid,
although not at the same pace. Hence, proteoses and even
peptones may make their appearance in the stomach-contents
at a very early period of digestion, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the final products
of proteolysis may be found in a mixture containing
even a large proportion of wholly unaltered proteid,
and obviously at an early stage in the process.
Expressed in other language, a portion of the first formed
acid-albumin or syntonin may be carried forward by the
digestive process to the secondary proteose and peptone
stage, before the larger portion of the ingested proteid food
has even combined with sufficient acid to insure the complete
formation of acid-albumin. This introduces another
factor, to be referred to later on, viz., the relative combining
power of different forms of proteid matter, especially the
proteoses and peptones, as contrasted with native proteids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span></p>

<p>In proof of the statement that pepsin-proteolysis can proceed
in the absence of free hydrochloric acid, provided combined
acid be present, allow me to cite one or two experiments
bearing on this point. A perfectly neutral solution
of egg-albumen, containing 0.8169 gramme of ash-free
albumin per 10&nbsp;c.c. of fluid, was employed as the proteid
material. In order to completely saturate the proteid contained
in 20&nbsp;c.c. of this neutral albumen solution, 50&nbsp;c.c. of
0.2 per cent. HCl were required. Two mixtures were
then prepared as follows:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Twenty c.c. of the neutral albumen solution + 50&nbsp;c.c.
0.2 per cent. HCl + 30&nbsp;c.c. of a weak aqueous solution of
pepsin, perfectly neutral to litmus. This mixture gave
only the faintest tinge of a reaction for free acid when
tested by Günzburg’s reagent.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Twenty c.c. of the neutral albumen solution + 25&nbsp;c.c.
0.2 per cent. HCl + 30&nbsp;c.c. of the neutral pepsin solution.
In this mixture, the proteid matter was obviously only half
saturated with acid.</p>

<p>The two solutions were placed in a bath at 40°&nbsp;C.,
where they were allowed to remain for forty-four hours, a
little thymol being added to guard against any possible
putrefactive changes. At the end of this time the amount
of undigested albumin was accurately determined. The 20&nbsp;c.c.
of original albumen solution contained 1.6338 grammes
of dry coagulable albumin. At the end of the forty-four
hours, <i>A</i> contained only 0.5430 gramme of unaltered albumin,
or acid-albumin, while <i>B</i> contained 1.2225 grammes.
That is to say, in the mixture <i>A</i>, where the acid existed
wholly in the form of combined acid, but with the albumin
completely saturated, 1.0908 grammes of the proteid were
converted into soluble albumoses and peptones. In <i>B</i>, on
the other hand, where the albumin was only half saturated
with acid, 0.4113 gramme of the proteid was converted<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
into soluble products. This difference in action is made
more striking by the statement that where the proteid was
only half saturated with acid, 25.1 per cent. of the albumin
was digested; while with a complete saturation of the proteid,
66.7 per cent. of the albumin was digested.</p>

<p>To give emphasis to this matter, a second experiment
may be quoted as follows: The proteid used was the
same neutral solution of egg-albumen containing 0.8169
gramme of albumin per 10&nbsp;c.c. Two mixtures were prepared
as follows:</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Ten c.c. of the neutral albumen solution + 21.7&nbsp;c.c.
0.2 per cent. HCl, the amount needed to completely saturate
the proteid, + 40&nbsp;c.c. of a weak solution of pepsin,
perfectly neutral.</p>

<p><i>B.</i> Ten c.c. of the albumen solution + 10.9&nbsp;c.c. 0.2 per
cent. HCl + 40&nbsp;c.c. of the pepsin solution, making a mixture
half saturated with acid.</p>

<p>These two solutions were warmed at 40°&nbsp;C. for seventeen
hours. The extent of digestive action was then determined,
when it was found that in <i>A</i> only 0.1638 gramme
of the proteid was undigested, while in <i>B</i>, 0.6088 gramme
remained unaltered. In other words, where the proteid
was completely saturated with acid, but with an utter lack
of free acid, 79.9 per cent. of the albumin was converted
into albumoses and peptone, while in the mixture half saturated
with acid only 25.4 per cent. was digested.</p>

<p>These two experiments thus give striking proof that free
acid is not absolutely essential for pepsin-proteolysis.
Digestion is, to be sure, more rapid and complete when
free hydrochloric acid is present, but proteolysis is still
possible, and even vigorous, when there is a marked deficiency
of free acid. Further, as we have seen, proteolysis
may proceed to a certain extent even though the amount
of acid available is not sufficient to combine with more
than half the proteid matter present.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span></p>

<p>These facts at once raise the question whether the products
of proteolysis may not have a stronger affinity for acid
than the native proteids; an affinity so strong that they may
be able to withdraw acid from the acid-albumin first formed.
One of our conceptions regarding pepsin-proteolysis is that
acid is necessary for every step in the proteolytic process.
A primary albumose, for example, cannot be further
changed by pepsin, unless there is acid present for it to
combine with. This being true, it is clear, in view of the
fact that even peptones may appear in a digestive mixture
containing an amount of acid insufficient to combine even
with the albumin present, that the products of proteolysis
must withdraw acid from the acid-albumin first formed. In
regard to the first point, my own experiments certainly
tend to show that the products of gastric digestion do combine
with larger amounts of hydrochloric acid than undigested
proteids; and further, that of the several products
of proteolysis, the secondary proteoses combine with a
larger percentage of acid than the primary proteoses,
while true peptones combine with still larger amounts.
In other words, the simpler and more soluble the proteid,
the larger the amount of acid it is capable of combining
with; a statement which accords with results obtained by
other <span class="nowrap">workers<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></span> in this direction. Further, another factor
of considerable importance in connection with the
natural digestive process is that a dissolved proteid, such
as protoalbumose for example, will combine more readily
with free acid than an insoluble proteid; from which
<span class="nowrap">Gillespie<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></span> is led to infer that in pepsin-proteolysis where
there is no free acid present, only acid-albumin, proteoses
may be formed to a limited extent at the expense of some
of the acid of the acid-albumin, a portion of the latter being<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span>
perhaps reconverted into albumin. The ability of the proteoses,
however, to withdraw acid from its combination
with a native proteid is perhaps best indicated by Kossler’<span class="nowrap">s<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></span>
experiments, which show that a solution of acid-albumin
containing only enough hydrochloric acid to hold the albumin
dissolved, on being warmed at 40°&nbsp;C. for some hours
with addition of a neutral solution of pepsin, may undergo
partial conversion into albumose or peptone.</p>

<p>In spite of these facts, there is some evidence that while
proteoses and peptones have the power of combining with
more acid than a like weight of native proteid, the latter,
leaving out all action of the pepsin, has a stronger affinity
for the acid; in fact, the firmness or strength of the union
appears to diminish as the products become simpler<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></span>
Hence, a peptone separated from a digestive mixture, will
part with its combined acid somewhat more readily than
acid-albumin for example, although on this point there is
not complete unanimity of opinion<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a></span> In digestive proteolysis,
however, where the pepsin is accompanied by a
minimal amount of hydrochloric acid, insufficient perhaps
to even half saturate the proteid present, the formation of
proteoses and peptones must be accompanied by a withdrawal
of acid from its combination with the native
proteid.</p>

<p>In illustration of some of these points, and especially of
the statement that the products of gastric digestion have
the power of combining with more hydrochloric acid than
the original proteid, allow me to cite the following experiment:
10&nbsp;c.c. of a neutral solution of egg-albumen contain<span class="pagenum" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>ing
about 0.82 gramme of pure dry albumin, free from
mineral salts, required 23.8&nbsp;c.c. of 0.2 per cent. hydrochloric
acid to completely saturate the proteid matter. A
mixture was then prepared as follows: 10&nbsp;c.c. of the
albumen + 24&nbsp;c.c. 0.2 per cent. HCl + 30&nbsp;c.c. of a neutral
pepsin solution, the mixture showing a faint trace of free
acid when tested by Günzburg’s reagent. This solution
was placed in a thermostat at 38°&nbsp;C., and from time to
time a drop of the fluid was removed and tested for free
acid. If no reaction could be obtained, 0.2 per cent.
hydrochloric acid was added to the mixture, until Günzburg’s
reagent showed free acid to be again present. The
following table shows the rate of disappearance of free
acid, and the amounts of 0.2 per cent. HCl required to
make good the deficiency. The mixture was placed at
38°&nbsp;C. on February 6th, at 11.30 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span>, and, as stated, contained
a trace of free acid, 24&nbsp;c.c. 0.2 per cent. HCl having
been added to accomplish this result.</p>

<p>From these results several interesting conclusions may
be drawn, in conformity with the statements already made.
Thus, as soon as proteolysis commences, the products
formed begin to show their greater affinity for acid by
withdrawing acid from its combination with the native<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
proteid, a supposition which is necessary to account for
even the starting of the proteolytic process. Further, it is
evident that proteoses and peptones combine with a far
larger equivalent of acid than the native albumin is capable
of; 17&nbsp;c.c. of 0.2 per cent. HCl being required in the
above experiment to satisfy the greater combining power
of the newly formed products. This doubtless depends
upon the cleavage of the large proteid molecule into a
number of smaller or simpler molecules, each of the latter,
perhaps, combining with a like number of HCl molecules.
This view of the relationship of the individual proteoses
and peptones is one more or less generally held, and is supported
by many facts<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></span> However this may be, it is evident
that the products of pepsin-proteolysis combine with a
larger amount of hydrochloric acid than the mother-proteid,
and that the transformation of the latter, at least
under the conditions of this experiment, is a slow and
gradual process. In the living stomach, on the other
hand, where the secretion of acid is progressing with ever-increasing
rapidity, it is easy to see that the process of
proteolysis would naturally be much more rapid.</p>

<p>Just here we may recall the theory advanced by <span class="nowrap">Richet<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></span>
quite a number of years ago that the acid of the gastric
juice is a conjugate acid, composed of leucin and hydrochloric
acid, a theory which has found little acceptance.
Klemperer<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">108</a></span> however, assumed that solutions of leucin
hydrochloride with pepsin would not digest albumin, but
Salkowski and <span class="nowrap">Kumagawa<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></span> have shown by experiments
that leucin and other amido-acids, as glycocoll, may be dis<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>solved
in hydrochloric acid in such proportion that the
solution is practically composed of leucin hydrochloride,
without interfering with the digestive action of pepsin-acid
on blood-fibrin; the solution being physio­logically active,
although Günzburg’s reagent shows an entirely negative
result for free acid. If the matter is studied quantitatively,
however, it will be found that the amido-acids
combining in this manner with the hydrochloric acid of
the gastric juice do give rise to some disturbance of proteolytic
action<span class="nowrap">;<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></span> <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, digestion may be less rapid, especially
on egg-albumin, a conclusion which <span class="nowrap">Salkowski<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">111</a></span> has lately
confirmed. Still, under such circumstances, digestion does
go on and at a fairly rapid rate; hence, if there is a combination
between the acid and these organic bodies, as is
indicated by Günzburg’s reagent, the acid is still active
physio­logically, even more so than in the compound formed
by the interaction of proteid and acid. In other words,
many of these neutral organic bodies that may originate in
the stomach through fermentative processes, or otherwise,
and which tend to combine with the acid of the gastric
juice, do not, as a rule, impede pepsin-proteolysis to the
same extent that an excess of proteid matter may. In
fact, in artificial digestions long continued, pepsin-acid
solutions containing considerable leucin, for example, may
accomplish as much in the way of digesting proteid matter
as the same amount of pepsin-acid without leucin; but the
inhibitory action of the amido-acid is there, and may be
shown during the first few hours of the experiment, when
less proteoses and peptones are formed than in the control
experiment without leucin.</p>

<p>It is foreign to our subject to discuss here methods for<span class="pagenum" title="56"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a></span>
the detection of so-called free and combined hydrochloric
acid in the stomach-contents, or the special significance of
such findings in health and disease. I cannot refrain,
however, in connection with what has been said above
concerning the proteolytic action of pepsin in the presence
of combined acid, from saying a word concerning the
usual deductions drawn from the absence of free acid in
the stomach-contents. As <span class="nowrap">Langermann<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></span> has recently
expressed it, we have methods for discriminating between
free and combined acid; we can, moreover, determine the
amount of free acid, but is it not equally important to be
able to say something definite concerning the amount of
combined acid in the stomach-contents? Even in the
absence of free hydrochloric acid there may be a sufficient
amount of HCl secreted to answer all the purposes of
digestion, and yet at no time may there be any free acid
present to be detected by the various color-tests ordinarily
made use of. I am aware that in ordinary examinations of
the stomach-contents after a test meal the results are
essentially comparative, and possibly all that are necessary
for clinical purposes. What I wish to emphasize, however,
is that in order to pass conclusively upon tsufficiency
or insufficiency of the gastric secretion, it is wise
to know not only the total acidity of the stomach contents
and whether there is free acid or not, but to know more
about the amount of combined acid present. Thus, there
is a natural tendency to divide the fluids withdrawn from
the stomach into three groups, viz., those which contain free
acid in moderate amount, those which contain free acid in
excess, and those in which free acid is entirely absent; but
in the latter group, there may be very marked differences
in the amount of acid combined with the proteid and other
material present. It appears to me that one of the ques<span class="pagenum" title="57"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a></span>tions
to be answered is whether there is sufficient combined
HCl present to meet all the requirements for digestion.
If there is, that gastric juice may be just as normal as the
one containing free mineral acid, and yet, according to our
present tendencies, we should be inclined to call the juice
containing no free acid abnormal, although there may be
sufficient combined acid present to meet all the requirements
for digestion. Hence, in examination of the stomach-contents,
it is well to consider the use of those methods
which tend to throw light upon the amount of combined
acid present, for in my opinion it is only by a determination
of the total amount of combined acid that we can
arrive at a true estimate of the extent of the HCl
deficiency. Obviously, in simple clinical examinations of
the stomach-contents after a test meal, where proteid
matter is not present in large amount, free acid may reasonably
be expected to appear after a definite period; but
in any event, it is well to remember that free hydrochloric
acid is not absolutely indispensable for fairly vigorous proteolytic
action, and that in the presence of moderate
amounts of proteid matter a large quantity of acid is
required to even saturate the albuminous material.</p>

<p>Consider for a moment the amount of acid a given
weight of proteid will combine with, before a reaction for
free acid can be obtained. Thus, <span class="nowrap">Blum<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></span> has stated that
100 grammes of dry fibrin will require 9.1 litres of 0.1 per
cent. hydrochloric acid to completely saturate it. Hence,
with a daily consumption of 100 grammes of proteid, there
would be needed for gastric digestion 4.5 litres of 0.2 per
cent. hydrochloric acid daily, and even this would not
suffice to give any free acid, assuming that none of the
acid is used over again. The results I have already given
for egg-albumin tend to show that 1 gramme of pure<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
albumin, free from inorganic salts, when dissolved in a
moderate amount of water will combine with about 30&nbsp;c.c.
of 0.2 per cent. hydrochloric acid. Consequently, on this
basis, 100 grammes of dry egg-albumin will combine with
3 litres of 0.2 per cent. HCl, and not until this amount of
acid has been added to such a mixture will reaction for
free acid be obtained with Günzburg’s reagent. Hence
we can easily see, in view of these figures, that the production
of hydrochloric acid by the gastric glands may at
times be very extensive, without the stomach-contents
necessarily containing free acid.</p>

<p>While I am by no means willing to agree with <span class="nowrap">Bunge<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></span>
that the chief importance of the acid of the gastric juice is
its action as an antiseptic, I am decidedly of the opinion
that the lack of free hydrochloric acid in the stomach-contents
is more liable to cause disturbance through the consequent
unchecked development of bacteria than through
lack of proteolytic action, assuming, of course, the presence
of a reasonable amount of combined HCl. The hydrochloric
acid of the gastric juice unquestionably plays a
very important part in checking the growth and development
of many pathogenic bacteria, as well as of less
poisonous organisms, which are taken into the mouth with
the food. On all, or at least on nearly all of these organisms,
hydrochloric acid exerts a far greater destructive
action when free than when combined with proteid matter.
As <span class="nowrap">Cohn<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></span> has plainly shown, both hydrochloric acid and
pepsin-hydrochloric acid quickly hinder acetic- and lactic-acid
fermentation, but when the acid is combined with
peptone, for example, it is no longer able to exercise the
same inhibitory influence. It is also important to note<span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span>
that the lactic-acid ferment is not so sensitive to hydrochloric
acid as the acetic-acid ferment. Consequently,
when lactic-acid fermentation is once developed a comparatively
large amount of HCl is required to arrest it.
Hence, as we all know, a diminished secretion of hydrochloric
acid renders possible acid fermentation of the
stomach-contents, as well as putrefactive changes which
would not occur in the presence of free HCl, and which
are very incompletely checked when the acid is over-saturated
with proteid matter.</p>

<p>Pepsin-proteolysis, however, may proceed, to some
extent, at least, even though a small amount only of combined
acid is present. The combined acid, however, must
be hydrochloric acid, if proteolysis is to be at all marked.
To be sure, pepsin will act in the presence of lactic acid,
as well as in the presence of other organic acids, and inorganic
acids, likewise, but such action at the best is considerably
weaker than the action of pepsin-hydrochloric acid<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></span></p>

<p>The ferment pepsin can exert its <i>maximum</i> action only
in the presence of free hydrochloric acid. There must be
sufficient HCl to combine with all of the proteid matter
present, and the products of proteolysis as fast as they are
formed, if digestion is to be rapid and attended with the
formation of a large proportion of the final products of
proteolysis. It is under such conditions that our study of
pepsin-proteolysis is usually conducted. Further, it is to
be remembered that our knowledge of the products of
such proteolytic action depends almost entirely upon data
accumulated by artificial digestive experiments. In no
other way can we be absolutely certain of the conditions
under which the proteolysis is accomplished, for it is a
significant fact, perhaps plainly evident from what has<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
already been said in the preceding lecture, that the character
of the products resulting from ordinary proteolysis is
dependent in great part upon the attendant circumstances.
Thus, with a relatively small amount of acid, and perhaps
also of pepsin, the initial products of proteolysis are especially
prominent, while with an abundance of both pepsin
and free acid, coupled with long-continued action, the final
products predominate. Between these two extremes there
are many possible variations, as was, I think, made clear in
the previous lecture. At the same time, it is to be noticed
that these differences are mainly differences in the <i>proportion</i>
of the several products, rather than in the nature of
the resultant bodies.</p>

<p>In a general way, the products of pepsin-proteolysis may
be divided into three main groups, viz., bodies precipitated
by neutralization and represented mainly by the
so-called syntonin or acid-albumin; bodies precipitated by
saturation of the neutralized fluid with ammonium sulphate
and represented by proteoses; bodies non-precipitable by
saturation with ammonium sulphate and represented by
amphopeptones. The relationship of the individual products
may be clearly seen from the following scheme,
arranged after the plan suggested by Neumeister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span></p>
<p>It is, of course, to be understood that this is not intended
to represent anything more than the order of formation of
the several bodies, no attention being paid here to the hemi-
or anti-character of the several products, or classes of
products. Thus, proto and heteroproteose are primary
bodies formed directly from the initial product syntonin
by the further action of the ferment. In the same sense,
deutero­proteose is a secondary proteose, being formed by
the further hydration of the primary body. Lastly, peptones,
the final products of pepsin-proteolysis, are the result
of the hydration and possible cleavage of deutero­proteoses.
Further, in almost every gastric digestion there is also
formed a small amount of antialbumid, a product insoluble
in dilute hydrochloric acid and which consequently appears
as an insoluble residue. This body is very resistant to the
action of pepsin-acid when once formed, but may be slowly
converted, in part at least, into a soluble antialbumose and
thence into antipeptone.</p>

<p>All of these bodies can be readily identified in any
digestive mixture containing them by a few simple reactions.
Thus, after having removed any acid-albumin or
syntonin present by neutralization, the concentrated fluid
can be tested at once. If primary proteoses are present,
the neutral fluid will yield a more or less heavy precipitate
on addition of crystals of rock-salt, precipitation being complete
only when the fluid is saturated with the salt.
Further, if the proteoses are present in not too small quantity,
nitric acid added drop by drop to the neutralized fluid
will produce a white precipitate, readily soluble on application
of heat but reappearing as the solution cools. If
primary proteoses are wholly wanting, then no precipitate
will be obtained by acid unless the fluid is saturated with
salt, in which case a portion of the deutero­proteose will be
precipitated. The two primary proteoses differ from each<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
other especially in solubility; protoproteose being readily
soluble in water alone, while heteroproteose is soluble only
in salt solutions, dilute acids, and alkalies. Hence, when
these two bodies are precipitated together by saturation
with salt, they may be readily separated by dissolving them
in a little dilute salt solution, and dialyzing the fluid in running
water until the salt is entirely removed; heteroproteose
will then be precipitated, while the proto-body remains in
solution.</p>

<p>By long contact with water, and even with concentrated
salt solutions, heteroproteose tends to undergo change into
a semi-coagulated form, named dysproteose, insoluble in
dilute sodium-chloride solutions. This body can be reconverted
into heteroproteose, in part at least, by solution in
dilute acid, or alkali, and reprecipi­tation by neutralization.</p>

<p>As a class, the proteoses are characterized by far readier
solubility in water than native proteids, by a far greater
degree of diffusibility, by non-coagulability by heat and by
alcohol, although precipitable by the latter agent. Further,
nearly all proteose precipitates are exceedingly sensitive
toward heat, tending to dissolve as the fluid is warmed and
reappearing as the solution cools. In fact, this peculiarity
often serves as a means of identification. Potassium ferrocyanide
and acetic acid, picric acid in excess, and likewise
cupric sulphate, all precipitate the primary proteoses, while
deutero­proteose is only slightly affected by these reagents,
or indeed not at all.</p>

<p>In order to separate the secondary proteose from the
primary bodies in the absence of peptones, the fluid is neutralized
as nearly as possible, and then, after suitable concentration,
is saturated with sodium chloride for the partial
precipitation of the primary proteoses. To the clear filtrate,
acetic <span class="nowrap">acid<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></span> is added drop by drop as long as a precipitate<span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
results, the latter being composed of a mixture of protoproteose
and deutero­proteose. That is to say, protoproteoses
are not completely precipitated from neutral solutions by
saturation with salt alone; a little acid is required to complete
it, but this tends to bring down a certain amount of
deutero­proteose. From this filtrate, however, the deutero-body
can be separated in a pure form by dialyzing away
the salt and acid, and then concentrating the fluid and precipitating
with alcohol. When the proteoses are mixed
with peptones, the former must first be separated collectively
by saturation of the fluid with ammonium sulphate.</p>

<p>Peptones are especially characterized by non-precipitation
with the ordinary precipitants for proteid bodies,
and especially by the fact that they are wholly indifferent
to saturation with ammonium sulphate either in neutral,
acid, or alkaline fluids. This reaction, which constitutes
the main, and perhaps the only absolute method of separating
peptones from proteoses must be carried out with great
thoroughness in order to insure a complete precipitation of
deutero­proteose. The latter stands midway between primary
proteoses and peptones in many respects, and seems to
share with peptones something of a tendency to resist precipitation
by the ammonium salt. Indeed, as <span class="nowrap">Kühne<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></span> has
recently pointed out, the last traces of deutero­proteose can
be precipitated from the fluid only by long continued boiling
of the ammonium sulphate-saturated fluid, and even
then it is seldom complete unless the reaction of the fluid
is alternately made neutral, acid, and alkaline, and the heating
continued for some time after each change in reaction.
Under such circumstances, the last portions of deutero­proteose
separate from the salt-saturated fluid and float on the
surface in the form of an oily or gummy mass, while the<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
true peptone remains in the fluid absolutely non-precipitable
by the salt.</p>

<p>In this filtrate, peptone can be detected by adding to a
small portion of the fluid a very large excess of a strong
solution of potassium hydroxide, followed by the addition
of a few drops of a very dilute solution of cupric sulphate.
If peptone is present a bright red color will appear, the
intensity of which, with the proper amount of cupric sulphate,
will be proportional to the amount of peptone present.
If it is desired to separate the peptone from the
ammonium-sulphate-saturated fluid, there are several
methods available, of which the following is perhaps the
most satisfactory: The fluid is concentrated somewhat,
and set aside in a cool place for crystal­liza­tion of a
portion of the ammonium salt. The fluid is then mixed
with about one-fifth its volume of alcohol, and allowed to
stand for some time, when it separates into two layers&mdash;an
upper one, rich in alcohol, and a lower one, rich in salts.
The latter is again treated with alcohol, by which another
separation of the same order is accomplished. Finally,
the lighter alcoholic layers containing the peptone are
united, and exposed to a low temperature until considerable
of the contained salt crystallizes out. The fluid is
then concentrated, and after addition of a little water is
boiled with barium carbonate until the fluid is entirely
free from ammonium sulphate. Any excess of baryta
in the filtrate is removed by cautious addition of dilute
sulphuric acid, after which the concentrated fluid,
reduced almost to a sirupy mass, is poured into absolute
alcohol for precipitation of the peptone.</p>

<p>So separated, the peptone formed in gastric digestion is
exceedingly gummy, but can be transformed into a yellowish
powder, very hygroscopic, of more or less bitter taste,
and, when thoroughly dry, dissolving in water with a hiss<span class="pagenum" title="65"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a></span>ing
sound and with considerable development of heat, like
phosphoric anhydride<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></span></p>

<p>I have introduced these dry chemical facts, none of
which are especially new, because I deem them of considerable
importance and because they are not very generally
known. In fact, there seems to be a tendency on the part
of some who are more or less familiar with the advances
made in our knowledge of the products of pepsin-proteolysis
to question the existence of these different bodies, or to
show at least a spirit of indifference toward these recent
facts which have been gradually accumulated, and I may
say accumulated at the expense of considerable labor. The
time is past for calling the products of gastric digestion
peptones; it is time for a full recognition of the fact that
pepsin-proteolysis is synonymous with the production of a
row of bodies, chemically and physio­logically distinct from
each other, each endowed with individuality enough to
admit of certain detection, and all bearing a certain
specific and harmonious relationship to their neighbors, the
other members of the series.</p>

<p>Further, it is not enough to admit the formation of a single
intermediate body, midway between syntonin and peptone.
The so-called propeptone of the past is simply a mixture
of proteoses, of ever changing composition, varying
with each change in the proportion of the component proteoses.
Each of these proteoses can be detected, under
suitable conditions, in the products of every artificial digestion
as well as in the stomach-contents, and no better
measure of the proteolytic power of the natural stomach-secretion
can be devised than a study of the character of
the individual bodies present in the stomach-contents after
a suitable test meal. The proper tests and separations can<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
be made with a small amount of the filtered fluid, and much
light thrown upon the digestive power of the secretion by
even a rough estimate of the proportion of primary and
secondary proteoses and peptones formed in a given time,
after the ingestion of a certain amount of proteid food.</p>

<p>In pepsin-proteolysis we have to deal, in my opinion,
with a series of progressive hydrolytic changes in which
peptones are the final products of the transformation.
Commencing with the formation of acid-albumin or syntonin,
hydrolysis and cleavage proceed hand in hand, under
the guiding influence of the proteolytic enzyme, and each
onward step in the process is marked by the appearance of
a new body corresponding to the extent of the hydrolysis;
each body, perhaps, being represented by a row or series of
isomers, all externally alike, but different in their inner
structure, according to the proportion of hemi- and anti-groups
contained in the molecule. As opposed to this
theory, we have the older views of Maly<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">120</a></span> Herth<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></span> <span class="nowrap">Henninger<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></span>
and others, based upon observations which tend to
show that peptones do not differ in chemical composition
from the proteids which yield them. As a matter of fact,
the products then analyzed were not peptones at all; they
were merely the <i>primary</i> products of pepsin-proteolysis, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
what we now term primary proteoses, and it is time we
stopped using such data to enforce the theory that peptones
are polymers of the proteids from which they are derived.</p>

<p>In 1886, the writer, in conjunction with Professor
Kühne, commenced a study of the various cleavage <span class="nowrap">products<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></span>
formed by the action of pepsin-hydrochloric acid<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>
from the better characterized and purer proteids, this being
a continuation of our earlier work on the proteoses and
peptones formed from blood-fibrin, serum-albumin, etc.
This work I have continued in my laboratory up to the
present time, with many co-workers, and as a result we
have to-day a series of observations gradually accumulated
during these last seven years, some the results of work carried
on this last year, which speak in no uncertain way of
the character of both the primary and secondary products
of pepsin-proteolysis. Furthermore, in attempting to settle
this question once for all, I have selected for study examples
from the various classes of both animal and vegetable
proteids; and as represen­ta­tives of the latter have had carried
out two lengthy series of experiments on the crystallized
proteids which occur so abundantly in some seeds, on
the assumption that these crystalline bodies would furnish
a certain guarantee of purity which might naturally be
lacking in the amorphous proteids of animal origin. Some
of these results are now placed together in the following
tables, a study of which reveals some very interesting facts:</p>

<p>In considering these results, it is to be noticed that there
is a general unanimity of agreement except in the case of
the albuminoid gelatin. In the proteolysis of this body,
for some reason not explainable, the digestive products
show no marked deviation from the composition of the
mother-proteid, but in every other instance there is to be
traced a distinct tendency toward diminution in the content
of carbon, proportional to the extent of proteolysis.
In the primary bodies, proto and hetero­proteoses, the percentage
of carbon is only slightly lowered; indeed, in
some few cases, notably in elastin and casein, the primary
products show a slight increase in their content of carbon,
but in most instances there is a slight falling off in the
percentage of this element. In the deutero­proteoses, however,
the loss of carbon is very marked. The percentage
loss, to be sure, varies with the different proteids, doubtless<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>
dependent in part upon the nature of the proteid itself,
and also, I think, upon the strength of the proteolytic
agent employed and the duration of the proteolysis. It is
to be further noticed that peptones, whenever analyzed,
show a still further loss of carbon and also a marked loss
of sulphur. In nitrogen there is no constant difference.</p>

<p>On the assumption that these various products of proteolysis
are formed by a series of hydrolytic changes,
accompanied by cleavage of the molecule, we might at first
glance look for a marked increase in the content of hydrogen.
But when we consider the size of the proteid molecule,
with the small proportion of hydrogen contained
therein and the large amount of carbon, it is plain that
hydrolytic cleavage might naturally leave its mark on the
percentage of carbon, rather than on the percentage of
hydrogen of the resultant products. In view of these facts,
the above results show nothing inconsistent with the theory
that pepsin-proteolysis, as a rule, is accompanied by a series
of progressive hydrolytic cleavages in which the primary
proteoses are the result of a slight hydration, these bodies
by continued proteolysis being further hydrated with
formation of secondary proteoses, which in turn undergo
final hydration and cleavage into true peptones. In accord
with this theory, true peptones always show a marked difference
in composition from that of the mother-proteid,
the most striking feature being the greatly diminished content
of carbon, which may be taken as a measure, in part
at least, of the extent of the hydrolytic change. And it is
to be noticed that the crystallized phytovitellins are no
exception to the general rule; the secondary vitelloses and
peptones resulting from proteolysis bear essentially the
same relationship to the mother-proteids that the albumoses
from egg-albumin do. Moreover, the alcohol-soluble proteids,
of which the zein of cornmeal is a good example,<span class="pagenum" title="72"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a></span>
show the same general tendency, and it is an interesting
fact that the proteoses, or more specifically the zeoses,
formed from this peculiar proteid, are readily soluble in
water and show the general proteose reactions. It may
also be mentioned that these zeoses, as well as the elastoses,
are very resistant to further hydrolysis by pepsin-acid, and
yield only comparatively small amounts of true peptones.</p>

<p>In connection with this question of the composition of
proteoses and peptones as formed by pepsin-proteolysis, it
is interesting to note a recent observation recorded by
Schützenberger<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></span> This experimenter took 350 grammes
of moist blood-fibrin, corresponding to 75.5 grammes of
dry substance, and subjected it to proteolysis with 2.5 litres
of a very strong pepsin-hydrochloric acid solution for five
days. The resultant fluid was then freed from acid by
treatment with silver oxide, after which the solution was
evaporated to dryness on a water-bath and the residue dried
<i>in vacuo</i>. This residue, termed by Schützenberger fibrin-peptone,
was found on analysis to contain 49.18 per cent.
of carbon, 7.09 per cent. of hydrogen, and 16.33 per cent.
of nitrogen, thus agreeing very closely with true fibrin-peptone
as analyzed by Kühne and myself. Further,
Schützenberger showed that the fibrin in undergoing this
transformation had taken on 3.97 per cent. of water. But
to my mind, the most significant fact connected with this
experiment is the positive evidence it affords, not only of
hydration as a feature of peptonization by pepsin-acid, but
that this greatly diminished content of carbon, so characteristic
of peptones, and to a less extent of deutero­proteoses,
is wholly independent of the methods of separation and
purification ordinarily made use of. Thus, Schützenberger,
in the above experiment, did not attempt any separation of<span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
individual bodies. Proteolysis was carried out under conditions
favoring maximum conversion into peptone, and
the resultant product, or products, was analyzed directly
without recourse to any methods of precipitation or purification.
To be sure, the substance analyzed could not
have been peptone entirely free from proteose, but in any
event it represented the terminal products of pepsin-proteolysis,
and like true amphopeptone contained 3.5 per
cent. less carbon than the original fibrin. Hence, we may
conclude, without further argument, that peptonization in
gastric digestion is the result of distinct hydrolytic action,
in which the original proteid molecule is gradually broken
down, or split apart, into a number of simpler molecules,
the proteoses and peptones.</p>

<p>Peptones, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, amphopeptones, are the final products of
gastric digestion; but to how great an extent is actual
peptonization carried on in pepsin-proteolysis? As we
have seen, syntonin, primary proteoses, secondary proteoses,
and peptones are all products of pepsin-digestion, and
it might perhaps be assumed that ultimately all of a given
proteid undergoing pepsin-proteolysis would be converted
into amphopeptone. Examination, however, shows that
such is not the case, at least in artificial digestive experiments.
Peptones are truly formed, and many times in
large amount, but never under any circumstances have I
been able to effect a complete transformation of any proteid
into true peptone by pepsin-proteolysis; there is
always found a certain amount of proteoses more or less
resistant to the further action of the ferment. Obviously,
the nature and proportion of the individual products
formed in any digestive experiment are dependent greatly
upon the attendant conditions; but even with a large
amount of active ferment, an abundance of free hydrochloric
acid, a proper temperature, and a long-continued<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
period of digestion, even five and six days, there is never
found a complete conversion into peptone. Indeed, the
largest yield of peptone I have ever obtained in an artificial
digestion is sixty per cent., while the average of a large
number of results under most favorable circumstances is
somewhat less than fifty per cent<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></span></p>

<p>We understand that peptones are the products of the
hydration and cleavage of previously formed proteoses.
The primary proteoses pass into secondary proteoses and
these into peptones, but for some reason this transformation
after a time becomes a slow and gradual process. At
first there is a marked and rapid progression; the proteid
undergoing proteolysis is rapidly dissolved, and both proteoses
and peptones may be detected in abundance. But if
we continue to watch the changing relations of primary
and secondary proteoses and peptones, we find that progression
soon ceases to be rapid, and eventually travels
onward at a snail’s pace. Thus, in one experiment with
coagulated egg-albumin, there was found at the end of
forty-eight hours’ digestion with pepsin-hydrochloric acid,
only thirty-seven per cent. of peptones with fifty-eight per
cent. of proteoses, and yet digestion had been sufficiently
vigorous to allow of a complete solution of the proteid in
two hours. At the end of seventy-two hours the amount
of peptones had increased to about forty-two per cent., the
proteoses having correspond­ingly diminished; but even at
the end of seventeen days only fifty-four per cent. of peptones
were to be found, thus affording striking evidence of
the slow conversion of the first-formed products into peptones.</p>

<p>Naturally, the individual proteoses show marked differences
in their rate of conversion into secondary or final<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
products. Take as an illustration some <span class="nowrap">results<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></span> obtained
with caseoses formed in the digestion of the casein of milk.
Thus, heterocaseose, a primary product, yielded only fifteen
per cent. of peptone after ninety-four hours at 40°&nbsp;C. with a
strong pepsin-acid solution. Protocaseose, however, containing
some deuterocaseose, under like conditions, yielded
thirty-two per cent. of peptone in one hundred and nineteen
hours, while pure deuterocaseose gave sixty-six per
cent. of peptone in one hundred and thirty-seven hours.
Evidently, then, the first-formed soluble products of gastric
digestion, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the primary proteoses, are only slowly converted
into peptone, since they must first pass through the
intermediate stage of deutero­proteose, which is plainly not
a rapid process. The deutero-body, on the other hand,
once formed is more rapidly converted into peptone, but
even this is in no sense a rapid process. Hence, in the
artificial digestion of proteids with pepsin-hydrochloric
acid, solubility of the proteids may be quite rapid, and
even complete in a very short time, but the resultant products
will be mainly proteoses and not peptones. The
latter are truly formed and in considerable amount, but
proteoses, either as primary or secondary bodies, are invariably
present and usually in excess of the peptones.</p>

<p>In this connection the question naturally arises how far
we are to trust these results in their bearing on the natural
process of digestion as it occurs in the living stomach.
Obviously, the conditions are quite different in the two
cases. In artificial digestions, we have especially the
influence of an ever-increasing percentage of soluble products
on the activity of the ferment, a condition of things
generally considered as more or less inhibitory to enzyme
action. We have attempted to measure the real value of<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
this influence by <span class="nowrap">experiments<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></span> conducted in parchment
dialyzing tubes, in which the conditions are made favorable
for the removal of at least some of the products of digestion
as fast as they are formed. In these experiments, the
dialyzer tubes containing the proteid and pepsin-acid were
immersed in a large volume of 0.2 per cent. hydrochloric
acid (about three litres), which was gradually changed from
time to time, the whole mixture being kept at 40°&nbsp;C. during
the entire period of the experiment. The extent of
peptonization was then ascertained by analysis of both the
contents of the dialyzer tubes and of the surrounding acid,
the results being compared with those obtained from control
experiments carried on in flasks. Without considering
the results in detail, it may be mentioned that the slow
and incomplete peptonization so characteristic of artificial
gastric digestion is not materially modified by this closer
approach to the natural process. The several digestions
carried on in the dialyzer tubes were certainly accompanied
by a fairly rapid withdrawal of the diffusible products of
digestion, yet no noticeable increase in the amount of peptone
formed was observed. The results certainly favor
the view that the conversion of the primary products of
gastric digestion into true peptone is a slow and gradual
process, even under the most favorable circumstances, and
that this lack of complete peptonization is not due to
accumulation of the products of digestion, but is rather an
inherent quality of pepsin-proteolysis under all circumstances.</p>

<p>In these dialyzer experiments it was observed that not
only did peptones diffuse, but also the proteoses. In fact,
it was found that six to eight per cent. of the proteoses<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
formed passed through the parchment walls of the dialyzer
tubes into the surrounding acid in the nine hours’ digestion.
This led to a study of the diffusibility of proteoses
in general, from which we were led to conclude that these
bodies possess this power to a greater degree than had
hitherto been supposed. As might be expected, it was
also found that the attendant conditions modify materially
the rate of diffusibility; the two factors especially prominent
being temperature and the volume of the surrounding
fluid. Thus, 1.9 grammes of protoalbumose dissolved in
200&nbsp;c.c. of water and suspended in 4.5 litres of water
heated to 38°&nbsp;C., diffused through the parchment tube to
the-extent of 5.09 per cent., while at 10°&nbsp;C. diffusion
amounted to only 2.57 per cent. Under somewhat similar
conditions, pure peptone diffused to the extent of eleven
per cent. in six hours at 38°&nbsp;C. Somewhat singular, however,
was the result obtained with deutero­albumose; this
proteose showing a diffusibility considerably less than that
of the proto-body. But as <span class="nowrap">Kühne<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></span> has independently
obtained essentially the same results, this apparent anomaly
cannot depend upon any errors of work.</p>

<p>It is of course to be understood that diffusion experiments
made with dead parchment membranes cannot
necessarily be expected to throw much light upon the rate
of absorption of these bodies through the living membranes
of the stomach and intestine, where, as Waymouth <span class="nowrap">Reid<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></span>
has well said, we have to deal with an absorptive force
dependent, no doubt, upon protoplasmic activity, and comparable,
in part at least, to the excretive force of a gland-cell.
Furthermore, in considering absorption as it occurs
in the living stomach, we must necessarily give due weight<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
to the selective power of the epithelial cells, a power which
may be far more potent even than we suppose. Hence,
without attempting at this point to draw any broad deductions
from our experiments we may simply lay stress upon
the facts themselves, viz., that the primary products of
pepsin-proteolysis are diffusible, and, like true peptones,
are capable of passing through animal and vegetable membranes,
although to a less extent. We may further emphasize
the fact that experiments of this character on diffusibility
can, at the most, only indicate general tendencies, since
every variation in the attendant conditions will exercise
some influence upon the final result.</p>

<p>With reference to the bearing digestive experiments
made in dialyzer tubes have upon the natural process as
carried on in the living stomach, we must necessarily grant
that the conditions approximate only in the crudest way to
those existent in the alimentary tract. At the same time,
if complete peptonization is characteristic of pepsin-proteolysis
in the stomach, and failure to obtain such results in
an artificial digestion is due to lack of withdrawal of the
diffusible products formed, then certainly the experiments
carried on in dialyzer tubes, with abundant opportunity for
diffusion, and with a large excess of free hydrochloric acid,
should show some indications of increased peptone-formation.
But none were obtained.</p>

<p>It is more than probable that the rate of absorption of
diffusible products from the stomach has been overestimated.
Lea<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></span> for example, assumes that, “normally the
products of digestion, whether proteid or carbohydrate,
are never met with in either the stomach or intestine
in other than the smallest amounts, frequently to be
described as merely traces.” This certainly implies a far
more rapid absorption of proteoses and peptones from the<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
stomach than results seem to justify. Indeed, recent facts
obtained by Brandl<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></span> working under Tappeiner’s direction,
tend to show that absorption from the stomach is, under
some circumstances at least, comparatively slow. Brandl’s
experiments were conducted on large and vigorous dogs
with gastric fistulæ, the stomach being shut off from the
intestine by the simple introduction of a small rubber
balloon into the pylorus, which when dilated completely
closed the orifice. By carefully conducted experiments, it
was shown that pure peptone, entirely free from proteose,
is absorbed from the empty stomach in proportion to the
concentration of the peptone solution. Thus, 7.5 grammes
of peptone dissolved in water in such proportion as to
make a five per cent. solution, and allowed to remain in
the stomach for two hours, lost by absorption only 0.28
gramme, equal to 2.68 per cent. of the peptone introduced.
Under similar conditions, a ten per cent. aqueous solution
of peptone lost only 4.5 per cent. by absorption. On the
other hand, when peptone was introduced in larger quantity,
viz., in a twenty per cent. solution, absorption
amounted to thirteen per cent. in two hours.</p>

<p>It is thus evident that pure peptones, even when taken
into the stomach in fairly large amounts, and under conditions
very favorable for rapid absorption, pass into the
circulating blood very slowly. Obviously, however, one
must not lose sight of the fact that when digestion is under
way and the volume of blood consequently increased, there
may be a corresponding rise in the rate of absorption.
There is perhaps a hint of this conclusion in the influence
of alcohol on the absorption of peptone as brought out by
some of Brandl’s experiments. Thus, it was found that
when alcohol was added in considerable quantity to a ten<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
per cent. solution of peptone, the stomach-mucosa was
greatly reddened, while in two hours the absorption of
peptone amounted to 11.8 per cent. But in any event,
these results certainly do not favor the view that the products
of gastric digestion are absorbed as soon as they are
formed. It is, no doubt, quite different in the intestine,
but in the stomach, where pepsin-proteolysis occurs, we
have, I think, no grounds for assuming that either peptones
or proteoses are rapidly absorbed. Hence, it might
perhaps be considered that the results of pepsin-proteolysis
in the living stomach are much the same as those obtained
in artificial digestion experiments.</p>

<p>Still, there are other differences between natural digestion
and artificial proteolysis than those connected with the
possible absorption of the more diffusible products of
digestion. Thus, in the living stomach there is an ever-increasing
secretion of hydrochloric acid, and perhaps also
of pepsin, more or less proportional to the extent of proteolysis.
On this point Brandl’s experiments again give us
some light. Thus, it was found that the introduction of
an aqueous solution of peptone into the empty stomach led
to the secretion of an acid fluid containing on an average
0.24 per cent. HCl, while, under similar conditions,
the introduction of sugar or potassium iodide was followed
by the secretion of a fluid containing on an average only
0.13 per cent. HCl. Further, the absolute amount of acid
found after the introduction of peptone was far greater
than when sugar or iodide was introduced, since peptone
led to an increase of at least fifty per cent. in the volume
of fluid secreted. Hence, proteolysis in the living stomach
may give rise to such an increased production and secretion
of hydrochloric acid that formation of the terminal
products of gastric digestion may be greatly accelerated.
That such in fact is the case, I have no manner of doubt,<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
but that it may result in the complete conversion of the
so-called primary and secondary proteoses into peptone I
very much question. In fact, such examinations as I
have made of the stomach-contents after a suitable test-meal
have always resulted in the finding of a relatively
large amount of proteoses. To be sure, true peptone may
be detected and in fairly large amounts, but whenever a
quantitative determination of the relative proportion of the
two has been made, the proteoses have always been in
excess. I have already reported elsewhere the results of
some experiments in this direction made on a healthy
young man, where the stomach-contents were withdrawn
at varying periods after the ingestion of weighed amounts
of coagulated egg-albumin. Thus, in one <span class="nowrap">experiment<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></span> the
stomach was thoroughly rinsed with water, after which 138
grammes of finely divided coagulated-albumin, equal to 16
grammes of dry albumin, were ingested. Three-quarters
of an hour thereafter, the stomach-contents were withdrawn
by lavage and analyzed. As a result, 1.41 grammes
of albumoses were separated and weighed, and 0.84 gramme
of peptones, the relative proportion being expressed by
sixty-two per cent. of albumoses and thirty-seven per cent.
of peptones, calculated on the 2.25 grammes of soluble products
recovered. This expresses the general character of
the results obtained in experiments of this nature, and in
my opinion adds emphasis to the statement already made,
that complete peptonization is not a feature of pepsin-proteolysis,
either in the artificial or in the natural process
as it takes place in the living stomach.</p>

<p>Gastric digestion is to be considered rather as a preliminary
step in proteolysis, preparatory to the more profound
changes characteristic of pancreatic digestion, in which the
ferment trypsin is the important factor. We can thus see<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
how, as in the case of Czerny’s dogs, an animal may be perfectly
nourished without a stomach, digestive proteolysis
being carried on solely by the pancreatic fluid. You will
remember that two of the dogs operated on by Czerny and
his pupils lived between four and five years after the
operation, with the stomach completely removed, and yet
during this period they were well nourished and ate all
varieties of food with apparently a normal appetite<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></span>
Evidently, then, in some cases at least, digestive proteolysis
can be carried on without this preliminary action of
the gastric juice. <span class="nowrap">Ogata<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></span> arrived at essentially the same
conclusion by the establishment of a duodenal fistula, shutting
off the stomach from the intestine by means of a small
rubber ball which could be inflated with water. On then
introducing coagulated egg-albumin and other forms of
proteid matter into the duodenum, he found that digestion
was at least sufficiently complete to satisfy all the demands
of the system. The only unsatisfactory result was with
collagenous foods, which plainly showed the need of a preliminary
acid digestion. More recently still, Cawallo and
Pachon<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></span> working in Richet’s laboratory, have studied the
digestibility of different kinds of proteid foods in a dog,
upon which they had performed a gastrectomy; the
entire fundus, as well as the pyloric portion, of the stomach
having been removed. In an animal so operated upon,
after recovery was complete, solid food, as meat, was completely
digested when taken in small quantities at a time.
Raw meat, however, was less completely utilized, the fæces
showing portions of undigested fibres. Still, it was
apparent that intestinal digestion alone was capable of<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
accomplishing all that was necessary for the complete
nourishment of the animal, when it had once become
accustomed to the changed condition of its alimentary
tract.</p>

<p>These facts are cited not to belittle the importance of
gastric digestion in the nutrition of the body, but rather to
emphasize the probability that pepsin-proteolysis is simply
a preliminary step in digestion; that its function is not in
the direction of a complete peptonization of the proteid
foods ingested, but that its action is especially directed to
the production of soluble products, proteoses, which can be
further digested in the small intestine, or perhaps directly
absorbed after they have passed through the pylorus, or
even from the stomach itself to a certain extent.</p>


<h4>SOME PHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES OF PROTEOSES
AND PEPTONES.</h4>

<p>It is very evident from what has been said that all forms
of proteid matter, <i>i.e.</i>, all the members of the three main
groups spoken of in our classification of the proteids,
excepting only nuclein, reticulin, and the keratins, are
capable of undergoing proteolysis with pepsin-hydrochloric
acid. Further, in every case the main products of the
transformation are proteoses; viz., albumoses, caseoses,
gelatoses, vitelloses, myosinoses, etc., according to the
nature of the proteid undergoing proteolysis; true peptones
being formed in less abundance. Corresponding to
each of these groups are primary and secondary proteoses,
all possessed of many points in common, both chemical
and physiological, yet differing from each other in many
minor respects. These are the important products of
gastric digestion, of pepsin-proteolysis, and it may be well<span class="pagenum" title="84"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a></span>
to consider for a moment some of the physiological properties
of the proteoses and of peptones as well, in order that
we may the better comprehend the general nature of these
substances with reference to their possible action in the
economy.</p>

<p>As far back as 1880, Schmidt-<span class="nowrap">Mülheim<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></span> discovered that
the injection of aqueous solutions of peptone into the
blood-vessels of living dogs was attended by a series of
remarkable phenomena. Thus, the animal passed at once
into a condition of narcosis resembling that produced by
chloroform, accompanied by a fall of general blood-pressure
so great that the animal was liable to die, as from
asphyxia. Further, there was evidence of some marked
change in the condition of the blood, as indicated by loss
of the power of spontaneous coagulation, while the peptone
itself evidently underwent some alteration, or else was
rapidly eliminated, since it could not be detected in the
blood a short time after its introduction. These experiments,
however, were not conducted with true peptone
but with Witte’s “peptonum siccum,” which at that time,
at least, was composed in great part of proteoses. The
general character of these interesting results was confirmed
by Fano<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></span> who found that the injection of so-called peptone
in the proportion of 0.3 gramme per kilo. of body-weight
was sufficient to bring about complete narcosis,
together with loss of coagulability on the part of the blood.
Very suggestive, however, was the fact that Fano, on trying
similar experiments with the peptone formed by pancreatic
digestion, viz., with antipeptone, which presumably
contained a far smaller proportion of proteoses, failed to
obtain like results; the tryptone, so-called, being exceed<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>ingly
irregular in its action, in many cases producing no
effect whatever.</p>

<p>The discovery at this date of the several albumoses, and
their presence in large amounts in all so-called peptones,
led to a study of their physiological action with special
reference to the observations of Schmidt-Mülheim and
Fano. Politzer<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></span> working under Kühne’s guidance, was
the first to experiment in this direction, and his results are
full of interest as throwing light on the action of the
individual albumoses. Thus proto, hetero, and deutero­albumose
are all active physio­logically, giving rise when
injected into the veins of dogs and cats to strong narcotic
action, varying somewhat in intensity in different individuals.
There is also produced a marked fall in blood-pressure,
due apparently to vaso-motor paralysis, the action
being manifested chiefly, if not wholly, on the splanchnic
region. Thus, after an injection of one of these albumoses,
the mesenteric vessels are always strongly congested,
accompanied frequently by the appearance of a bloody
serum in the peritoneal cavity. Narcotic action is manifested
only so long as the blood-pressure remains sub-normal,
and is due presumably to this marked accumulation of
blood in the large abdominal veins, thus leading to anæmia
of the brain. Albumoses and peptones injected into the
jugular vein likewise produce fever, presumably through
some action on the nervous system by which the equilibrium
of tissue-metamorphosis is interfered with<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></span></p>

<p>Further, Politzer found that all of the albumoses either
delayed or prevented altogether the coagulation of the
blood, in conformity with the observations of Schmidt-Mülheim
and Fano. In all of these actions the primary<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
albumoses appeared most effective, deutero­albumose least
so. Heteroalbumose, however, was constantly most active,
especially in delaying the coagulation of the blood. With
amphopeptone, there was far less narcosis and less diminution
of blood-pressure, while the effect on the coagulability
of the blood was more or less variable, frequently being
entirely negative. Antipeptone, on the other hand, was
found almost wholly wanting in any constant effects,
although in one instance deep narcosis was produced.
Thus, from Politzer’s experiments, it was made clear that
the albumoses, when introduced directly into the blood-current,
possess a far greater toxic action than either
amphopeptone or antipeptone. Albumoses, in sufficiently
large doses, were invariably fatal, while peptones never
produced fatal results so long as the kidneys of the animal
remained intact. The extreme solubility and diffusibility
of peptones, coupled perhaps with their marked diuretic
action, lead to rapid elimination through the kidneys, and
their consequent removal from the system.</p>

<p>Many of these observations made with the albumoses I
have repeated with several of the proteoses and peptones
more recently studied, as protocaseose, protoelastose, the
globuloses, and others. The results may be taken as practically
confirmatory of the older observations, and I make
mention of them in this general way simply to emphasize
the fact that all of the proteoses, though perhaps showing
individual peculiarities, are possessed of marked physiological
properties, which plainly testify to their toxic nature,
when introduced directly into the blood-current.</p>

<p>Young animals are particularly sensitive to the injection
of proteoses into the blood, even when the introduction
takes place very gradually<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></span> Thus, a young, healthy dog<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
of 2 kilos. body-weight, eight weeks old, died in one hour
after the injection into the jugular vein of 1 gramme of
protoalbumose in 20&nbsp;c.c. of water, thus affording a good
illustration of the extreme toxicity of this albumose when
introduced directly into the blood.</p>

<p>Of greater interest, physiologically, are the changes the
individual proteoses undergo after their injection into the
blood. As already stated, peptone so injected may appear
in the urine wholly unaltered. Thus, <span class="nowrap">Neumeister<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></span> has
made injections of both amphopeptone and antipeptone in
the case of dogs, and was able to detect the peptone very
quickly in the urine. I have made like experiments with
other forms of peptone and obtained similar results; thus,
a pure amphopeptone formed from casein by pepsin-proteolysis
(2 grammes in 15&nbsp;c.c. water) was injected into the
jugular vein of a dog weighing 5 kilos. The urine collected
during several hours after the injection was heated
to boiling, and saturated while hot with ammonium
sulphate. The filtrate, on being tested with cupric sulphate
and potassium hydroxide, gave a fairly strong biuret
reaction for peptone. Another similar experiment made
with antipeptone, formed from the myosin of muscle-tissue,
gave like results.</p>

<p>With proteoses, however, different results are obtained,
as <span class="nowrap">Neumeister<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></span> first pointed out. These bodies introduced
into the blood undergo more or less of a change prior to
their excretion in the urine, the change partaking of the
character of a hydrolytic cleavage in which the primary
proteoses are transformed into secondary proteoses, while
deutero­proteoses are changed into peptones. This is not
necessarily to be interpreted as meaning that the full
equivalent of the proteose injected appears in the urine,
but that the portion which is eliminated through the kid<span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span>neys
tends to undergo a transformation somewhere <i>en
route</i>, akin to the change produced in pepsin-proteolysis.
As to how common or complete this transformation is
under the above circumstances, we have no positive knowledge.
Such a hydrolytic change certainly occurs in the
case of the dog, and the experimental evidence is in favor
of the view that the transformation is effected in the kidneys
by the pepsin secreted through the urinary tubules,
where there is momentarily a formation of free acid. In
the rabbit, on the other hand, no such change occurs; the
urine from this animal contains practically no pepsin, and
consequently the proteoses eliminated through the kidneys
are excreted unaltered. As, however, the experiments of
<span class="nowrap">Stadelmann<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></span> and others have shown that the urine of all
carnivora, and of man as well, contains a ferment which,
on the addition of a suitable amount of hydrochloric acid,
will digest fibrin with formation of the ordinary products
of pepsin-proteolysis, it is to be presumed that all proteoses
passing through the kidneys will undergo at least some
change prior to their excretion in the urine.</p>

<p>However this may be, it is very evident that the proteoses
formed in gastric digestion cannot be absorbed as
such directly into the blood-current. Introduced into the
blood, they behave in such a manner as to warrant the conclusion
that they are truly foreign substances, and the system
makes a brave endeavor to remove them as speedily as
possible. The same may be said of amphopeptones, from
which we may conclude that all of these products of pepsin-proteolysis
undergo some transformation during the
process of absorption, by which their toxicity is destroyed
and their nutritive qualities rendered fully available for
the needs of the body. Discussion of this question, however,
will be left until the next lecture.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span></p>

<p>In view of these pronounced physiological properties of
the proteoses, it is interesting to recall the now well-known
fact that many of the chemical poisons produced by bacteria
are proteose-like bodies, chemically, at least, closely akin
to the proteoses resulting from pepsin-proteolysis. Thus,
<span class="nowrap">Wooldridge<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></span> as early as 1888 pointed out that an alkaline
solution of tissue-fibrinogen exposed to the action of
anthrax-bacilli suffered some change, so that when introduced
into the blood it possessed the power of producing
immunity to anthrax. This observation was verified by
Hankin<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></span> who further showed that the substance formed
by the anthrax-bacilli was a veritable albumose, and that it
truly possessed the power of producing immunity. Sidney
<span class="nowrap">Martin<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></span> carried the matter still further, and by growing the
anthrax-bacilli in a pure solution of alkali-albuminate prepared
from blood-serum, proved the formation of both
primary and secondary albumoses, as well as of peptone,
leucin, tyrosin, and a peculiar alkaloidal substance of pronounced
toxic properties. Martin finds that the albumoses
are not as poisonous as the alkaloid, and surmises that the
alkaloid is contained in the albumose molecule in the
nascent state; further, he suggests that the albumoses in
small doses may exert some protective influence, while in
larger doses they act as vigorous poisons. How true this
may be I cannot say, but my own experience convinces me
that the anthrax-bacilli grown in a culture medium composed
of alkali-albuminate, prepared from egg-albumin, to
which the necessary inorganic salts and some glycerin have
been added, do give rise to albumoses and peptones which
are truly endowed with toxic properties.</p>

<p>Albumose-like bodies have also been obtained by Brieger<span class="pagenum" title="90"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span>
and <span class="nowrap">Fränkel<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></span> with the bacillus of diphtheria. These, too,
were endowed with powerful poisonous properties, and
when introduced into the tissues of the body gave rise to
reactions resembling those produced by the Löffler bacillus.
In my own laboratory, recent experiments made with the
bacillus of glanders have shown that when grown in a
slightly acid medium containing alkali-albuminate, albumoses,
peptones, and crystalline bodies such as leucin and tyrosin
are formed in considerable quantities. <span class="nowrap">Kresling<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></span> has
reported similar results. With the tubercle-bacilli, many
like results have been recorded. Thus, among others,
Crookshank and <span class="nowrap">Herroun<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></span> have reported the finding of
albumoses, peptone, and a ptomaine when the bacilli have
been grown in glycerin agar-agar, and also in fluid media.</p>

<p><span class="nowrap">Koch<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></span> has made a special study of the albumose which
he considers as the specific toxic agent of the so-called
tuberculin. This albumose was found by Brieger and
<span class="nowrap">Proskauer<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></span> to have a somewhat peculiar composition, inasmuch
as it contains forty-seven to forty-eight per cent. of
carbon and only 14.73 per cent. of nitrogen, agreeing,
however, in this respect very closely with the peptone
formed from egg-albumin by the action of bromelin<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></span> Still
more recently, <span class="nowrap">Kühne<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></span> has made a thorough study of this
albumose, as well as of the other products elaborated by the
growth of the tubercle-bacillus. He designates all of the
peculiar albumoses formed by these bacilli as <i>acrooalbumoses</i>.
They are endowed with marked chemical and<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
physiological properties, causing a rise of temperature
when injected into the blood, as well as other phenomena
more or less pronounced. It is thus evident there is ample
ground for the statement that all nutritive media in which
pathogenic bacteria have been planted are liable to contain,
sooner or later, toxic substances, many of which at least are
closely related to, if not identical with, the albumoses. It
is not my purpose, however, to consider these points in
detail, nor to quote the many results obtained by other
workers in this direction.</p>

<p>I wish merely to call attention to the fact that the proteoses,
and likewise the peptones formed by pepsin-proteolysis,
are more or less toxic when introduced directly into
the blood, and that they share this property with the proteoses
formed by bacterial organisms, or by the enzymes which
they give rise to. In other words, these primary cleavage
or alteration products of the proteid molecule, however
produced, are more or less poisonous, and if introduced
into the blood-current without undergoing previous change
may show marked physiological action. It is, of course, not
to be understood that these bodies are all alike. They are
surely closely related and possess many points in common,
especially so far as their chemical properties are concerned,
but their chemical constitution and their physiological
action must vary more or less with their mode of origin.</p>

<p>In any event, it is very evident that the proteoses and
peptones formed in the alimentary tract by pepsin-proteolysis
must undergo some transformation, before reaching
the blood-current, by which their peculiar physiological
properties are modified. This modification may be associated
with a conversion into the serum-albumin, or globulin
of the blood. However this may be, the fact remains
that these proteoses formed so abundantly during digestion
can be absorbed and serve as nutriment for the animal<span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>
body, but between their formation as a result of proteolysis
and their passage into the blood they are exposed to some
agency, or agencies, doubtless in the very act of absorption,
by which a further transformation is accomplished. With
this point we shall be able to deal more in detail in the
next lecture.</p>

<h2>LECTURE III.</h2>

<h3>PROTEOLYSIS BY TRYPSIN&mdash;ABSORPTION OF THE MAIN
PRODUCTS OF PROTEOLYSIS.</h3>


<h4>PROTEOLYSIS BY TRYPSIN.</h4>

<p>In pancreatic digestion, proteids are exposed to the action
of an enzyme of much greater power than pepsin, one
endowed with a far greater range of activity, and consequently
proteolysis as it occurs in the small intestine
becomes a broader and more complicated process. As you
well know, the ferment trypsin manifests its power not
only in a more rapid transformation of insoluble proteids
into soluble and diffusible products, but there is a diversity
in the character of the many products formed which testifies
to the profound alterations this ferment is capable of
producing. The primary and secondary products of pepsin-proteolysis,
as well as unaltered proteids, are alike subject
to these changes, and bodies of the simplest constitution
may result in both cases from the series of hydrolytic
changes set in motion by this proteolytic enzyme. The
power of the ferment as a contact agent is astonishing, for
in the case of trypsin no accessory body is necessary to
bring out its latent power. Water, proteid, and the
enzyme at the body-temperature are all that is necessary
to call forth prompt and energetic hydrolytic action.</p>

<p>Moreover, hydrolysis does not stop with the mere production
of soluble proteoses and peptones, but the hemi-portion
of the latter is quickly broken down into crystalline
bodies, such as leucin, tyrosin, lysin, lysatin, etc. This
special characteristic of the ferment testifies in no uncertain
manner to the existence of inherent qualities in the<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
inner structure of the enzyme peculiar to the body itself.
In general properties and reactions, pepsin and trypsin
may be closely related; both are products of the katabolic
action of specific protoplasmic cells, but the inner nature
or structure of the two must be quite different. Pepsin,
as we have seen, is powerless to produce any change in
proteid bodies unless acids are present to lend their aid.
Furthermore, pepsin is limited in its action to the production
of proteoses and peptones, while trypsin gives rise to
a series of hydrolytic cleavages which result in the ultimate
formation of comparatively simple bodies.</p>

<p>Trypsin, however, in its natural environment is dissolved
in an alkaline medium. Its proteolytic action is therefore
carried on, under normal circumstances, in an alkaline-reacting
fluid containing 0.5 to 1 per cent. sodium carbonate,
and the proteolytic power of the ferment is unquestionably
manifested to the best advantage in such a medium. At
the same time, it will act, and act vigorously, in a neutral
fluid, and likewise in a fluid having a weak acid reaction,
provided there is little or no free acid present. Thus, in
<span class="nowrap">experiments<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></span> on blood-fibrin it was found that, while a
solution of trypsin containing 0.5 per cent. sodium carbonate,
digested or dissolved 89 per cent. of the proteid in
three to four hours at 40°&nbsp;C., a perfectly neutral solution
of the ferment, otherwise under exactly the same conditions,
digested 76 per cent., and a 0.1 per cent. salicylic
acid-solution of the enzyme converted 43 per cent. of the
proteid into soluble products.</p>

<p>With hydrochloric acid, trypsin is quickly destroyed,
unless there is a large excess of proteid matter present<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span><span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></span>
which obviously means that the acid in such case exists
wholly as combined acid. Indeed, experiments made in
my laboratory have shown that as soon as free acid, especially
hydrochloric acid, is present in a solution containing
trypsin, then proteolytic action is at once stopped. When,
however, acids, especially organic acids, are present in a
digestive mixture containing an excess of proteid matter,
so that the solution contains no free acid (or better, with
the proteid matter only partially saturated with acid) then
trypsin will continue to manifest its peculiar proteolytic
power, although to a considerably lessened extent. Hence,
it is evident that the ferment may exert its digestive power
under the three possible sets of conditions which, under varying
circumstances, frequently prevail in the small intestine.</p>

<p>In considering the general phenomena of proteolysis by
trypsin, one is especially impressed by the large and rapid
formation of peptone which almost invariably results
from the action of a moderately strong solution of the
ferment, on nearly every form of proteid matter. To be
sure, primary products are first formed, but these are
quickly converted into peptone, and a little experience in
studying the action of pepsin and trypsin soon reveals the
fact that the latter is especially a peptone-forming ferment.
In other words, it is peculiarly adapted to take up the work
where it has been left by pepsin and, if necessary, carry
forward the hydrolytic change even to the extent of a conversion
of the entire hemi-moiety into crystalline products.</p>

<p>The primary products of trypsin-proteolysis, however,
are not exactly identical with those formed by pepsin.
Thus, protoproteoses and hetero­proteoses seldom appear in
an alkaline trypsin digestion; the proteid matter being in
most cases, at least, directly converted into soluble deutero­proteoses<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></span>
which are then transformed by the further<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
action of the ferment into peptones and other products.
Hence, we may express the order of events in the trypsin
digestion of a native proteid as follows:</p>

</table></div>


<p>In the digestion of fresh blood-fibrin with trypsin, there
is plainly a preliminary solution of the proteid without any
marked transformation or cleavage occurring, the soluble
product being apparently a globulin, coagulating at about
75°&nbsp;C.<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></span> viz., at approximately the same temperature as
serum-globulin. This body, however, quickly disappears,
giving place to true deutero­proteoses as the ferment-action
commences; for it is not probable that this globulin is a
product of enzyme-action, but rather represents a simple
solution of the fibrin by the alkaline fluid and salts. In
any event, this globulin-like substance is not formed in the
pancreatic digestion of coagulated-albumin, serum-albumin,
or vitellin, and hence cannot be considered as a true
product of trypsin-proteolysis.</p>

<p>The fact that deutero­proteoses are the primary products
of trypsin-digestion again emphasizes the natural adaptability
of this ferment to the part it has to play in the
digestive process. Its natural function is to take up the
work where left by pepsin, and carry it forward to the<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
necessary point; and hence, when acting upon a native
proteid the primary products of its action correspond to
the secondary products of pepsin-proteolysis. Trypsin is
thus equally efficient in the digestion of all native proteids,
but the products of such action are always deutero­proteoses,
peptones, and crystalline amido-acids. It is to
be remembered, however, that in trypsin-proteolysis the
deutero­proteoses and the amphopeptones must necessarily
be represented by bodies in which there is a preponderance
of anti-groups. In pepsin-proteolysis, as we have
seen, the hemi- and anti-groups of the proteid molecule
remain more or less united, but in pancreatic digestion, the
formation of amphopeptone is quickly followed by the
breaking down of a portion of the hemipeptone into leucin,
tyrosin, etc. thus leaving a larger proportion of the anti-moiety
in the remaining amphopeptone.</p>

<p>Theoretically, at least, in the-case of a vigorous and
long-continued pancreatic digestion, all of the hemipeptone formed
from any native proteid can be converted into crystalline and other
products, thus leaving a true antipeptone resistant to the further
action of trypsin. Hence, we are prone to speak of the peptone of
pancreatic digestion as antipeptone, although, as can be readily seen,
the exact nature of the peptone, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the relative proportion
of hemi- and anti-groups it contains, will obviously depend upon the
length of the digestion and the strength of the ferment. Again, it
is possible, as certain facts seem to suggest, that the amido-acids
which are so readily formed from hemipeptone may come in part directly
from the hydration of a portion of the hemi­deutero­proteose, without
passing through the preliminary stage of hemipeptone. If so, we have
another source of variation in the relative proportion of hemi- and
anti-moieties in the deutero­proteoses and peptones of pancreatic
digestion. Still again, it is to be remembered that in normal
digestive proteolysis, as it occurs in the living<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
intestinal tract, the proteid matter to be acted upon has
already passed through certain preliminary stages in, its
transit through the stomach, as a result of which still
further variations in the proportion of hemi- and anti-groups
may be possible.</p>

<p>It is thus plainly evident, in view of the ready cleavage
of the hemi-group into amido-acids, that the primary products
of trypsin-proteolysis, the proteoses and peptones, must
necessarily be composed in great part of those complex and
semi-resistant atoms which we include under the head of
the anti-group. However much one may be skeptical
about the real existence of so-called hemi- and anti-groups,
there is no gainsaying the fact that a given weight of
native proteid, like egg-albumin or blood-fibrin, cannot be
converted wholly into crystalline or other simple products
by trypsin; indeed, it is quite significant that at the end
of a long-continued treatment with an alkaline solution of
the pancreatic ferment, there is usually found about fifty
per cent, of peptone, while the other fifty per cent. of
the proteid is represented mainly by more soluble products,
such as the amido-acids. It is also significant that the
peptone obtained from an artificial pancreatic digestion,
where the proteolytic action has been long-continued and
vigorous, resists the further action of the ferment. In
other words, it is the so-called antipeptone. In line with
this result is the fact that the peptones formed in pepsin-proteolysis,
when treated with an alkaline solution of trypsin,
are converted into amido-acids and other bodies of
simple constitution to the extent of about fifty per cent.
This is easily explainable on the ground that the hemi-portions
of the above peptones are broken down into simple
products, while the anti-portions remain unchanged,
being resistant to the ferment and thus leading to a separation
of the two groups, or at least to the isolation of the
anti-molecules.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span></p>

<p>There is much that might be cited in further support of
these views, but doubtless I have said enough to make it
plainly evident that in the pancreatic digestion of any
native proteid, not more than one-half can at the most be
transformed into crystalline products, while the other half
will be represented mainly by a peptone incapable of
further change by trypsin. Similarly, the products of
pepsin-proteolysis exposed to the action of trypsin may
undergo a like separation, the hemi-groups only breaking
down into simple products. Hence, the whole theory of
the hemi- and anti-moieties of the proteid molecule means
simply that of the many complex atoms composing the
molecule, one-half are easily decomposable by the pancreatic
ferment, while the other half are more resistant and
make up the so-called anti-group.</p>

<p>In any active pancreatic digestion of either a native
proteid, or of the products of pepsin-proteolysis, the anti-group
is represented mainly by antipeptone, although there
is often found a small amount of a peculiar antialbumid-like
body, insoluble in the weak alkaline fluid. Antipeptones,
thus far studied, when entirely free from proteoses,
are characterized by a low content of carbon, like the
amphopeptones from pepsin-proteolysis. The following
table shows the composition of a few typical examples:</p>

<p>From these data it is evident that, while each individual
peptone may have a composition peculiar to itself, they are
all alike in possessing a relatively low content of carbon.
The antialbumid, however, split off in these hydrolytic
changes, like the antialbumid formed by the action of
dilute acids at 100°&nbsp;C., is characterized by a correspond­ingly
high content of carbon and a low content of nitrogen.
As an illustration, may be mentioned the myosin-antialbumid
formed in the digestion of myosin from
muscle-tissue by an alkaline trypsin-solution. This body
contains 57.48 per cent. of carbon, 7.67 per cent. of hydrogen,
13.94 per cent. of nitrogen, 1.32 per cent. of sulphur,
and 19.59 per cent. of oxygen<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></span> It is only necessary to
compare these figures with those expressive of the composition
of myosin-antipeptone, to appreciate how wide a gap
there is between these two products of trypsin-proteolysis,
and both members of the anti-group. Antialbumid, however,
is a peculiar product, one which is liable to crop out
somewhat unexpectedly, and with varying shades of resistance
toward the proteolytic ferments. As formed in
pepsin-proteolysis, it is more or less readily soluble in
sodium carbonate, and in part readily convertible into
antipeptone by trypsin. Still, the same substance, or at
least a closely related body, makes its appearance in the
form of an insoluble residue whenever a native proteid is
digested by trypsin. At times, the amount of this insoluble
product may be quite large, even reaching to one-fourth
of the total proteid matter<span class="nowrap">;<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></span> but when so formed
in the intestine it must entail a heavy loss of nutriment,
for whenever the anti-group is split off after this fashion it
becomes very resistant to the further action of the ferment.
Separating in this manner from an artificial digestive<span class="pagenum" title="101"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a></span>
mixture, it may be dissolved in dilute caustic alkali, reprecipitated
by neutralization, and then once again brought
into solution with dilute sodium carbonate. In this form,
it will yield some antipeptone by the further action of
trypsin, although even then a large amount of the antialbumid
is prone to separate out as a gelatinous coagulum,
more or less resistant to the further action of the ferment.</p>

<div class="inline">The peculiar action of trypsin, however, as a proteolytic
enzyme is shown in the production of a row of crystalline
nitrogenous bodies of simple constitution whenever the ferment
is allowed to continue its action for any length of
time, either on native proteids or on proteolytic products
containing the hemi-group. This, to be sure, is a fact long
known, but it gains added significance as year by year new
bodies are discovered as products of trypsin-proteolysis
with various forms of proteid matter. The very character
of the bodies originating in this manner gives evidence of
the far-reaching decompositions involved; decompositions
which are perhaps attributable as much to the innate tendencies
of the proteid material as to the specific action
of the ferment. As represen­ta­tives of this peculiar line
of cleavage, we have first the well-known bodies, leucin and
tyrosin; leucin, a body belonging to the fatty acid series,
long known as amido-caproic acid, but now generally considered
as amido-isobutylacetic acid, (CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub> CH CH<sub>2</sub> CH
(NH<sub>2</sub>) COOH; and tyrosin, a body belonging to the aromatic
group, having the formula

<table class="inline">

<tr><td class="tal"><span class="ilb">CH<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;CH&nbsp;(NH<sub>2</sub>)&nbsp;COOH</span></td></tr>
</table>,

and known as oxyphenyl-amido-propionic acid.</div>

<p>These two bodies are therefore representatives of two
distinct groups or radicals present in the hemi-portion of
the proteid molecule; the first belonging to the fatty acid
series, the second to the aromatic group from which come
such well-known bodies as indol, skatol, benzoic acid, and<span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span>
other substances prominent in proteid metabolism. Moreover,
these two hydrolytic products of trypsin-proteolysis
are formed in considerable quantity, at least in an artificial
digestion. Thus, Kühne has reported the finding of 9.1
per cent. of leucin and 3.8 per cent. of tyrosin as the result
of a typical digestion, and I have tried many similar experiments
with like results. Further, we know from observations
made by different investigators that both leucin and
tyrosin may be formed in considerable quantities in trypsin-proteolysis
as it occurs in the living intestine. But to this
point we shall return later on.</p>

<p>Besides leucin and tyrosin, aspartic acid and glutamic
acid have long been known as decomposition-products of
the vegetable proteids. Thus, both acids were discovered
by Ritthausen and <span class="nowrap">Kreusler<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></span> in the cleavage of such proteids
by boiling dilute acid. Hlasiwetz and <span class="nowrap">Habermann<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></span>
likewise obtained aspartic acid in large quantity by the
breaking down of animal proteids under the influence of
bromine. Further, <span class="nowrap">Siegfried<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></span> has recently obtained glutamic
acid as a product of the decomposition of the phosphorus-containing
proteid, reticulin, from adenoid tissue. As
products of trypsin-proteolysis, Salkowski and <span class="nowrap">Radziejewski<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></span>
found aspartic acid in the digestion of blood-fibrin;
and v. <span class="nowrap">Knieriem<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></span> likewise obtained it in the digestion of
gluten from wheat. Both of these acids belong to the
fatty acid series, the aspartic acid being a dibasic acid,
<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>COOH.&#8199;CH<sub>2</sub>CH&#8239;(NH<sub>2</sub>).&#8199;COOH, or amido-succinic acid,
while glutamic acid, COOH.&#8199;C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>5</sub>&#8239;(NH<sub>2</sub>).&#8199;COOH, is likewise
a dibasic acid, known as amido-pyrotartaric acid.</p>

<p>Of more interest physiologically, are the recently discovered
nitrogenous bases lysin and lysatinin, or lysatin.
These two bodies were first identified by <span class="nowrap">Drechsel<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></span> and his
co-workers as products of the decomposition of various proteids,
when the latter are boiled with hydrochloric acid and
stannous chloride. They were first obtained by Drechsel
as cleavage products of casein<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></span> Later, Ernst Fischer<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></span>
working under Drechsel’s direction, separated them as
decomposition-products of gelatin; while <span class="nowrap">Siegfried<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></span> obtained
them as products of the cleavage of conglutin,
gluten-fibrin, hemiprotein, and egg-albumin, by boiling with
hydrochloric acid and stannous chloride. In all of these
cases it is obvious, from the method of treatment pursued,
that the two bodies result from a simple hydrolytic cleavage
of the proteid molecule. Hence, it might be assumed
that these two bases would likewise be formed in trypsin-proteolysis.
This assumption, Hedin<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></span> working in Drechsel’s
laboratory, has proved to be correct, and furthermore
he has shown that the amount of these bases formed in
pancreatic digestion is not inconsiderable. Thus, as products
of the digestion of three kilos. of moist blood-fibrin
with an alkaline solution of trypsin, 28 grammes of pure
platino-chloride of lysin were obtained, and sufficient lysatinin
to establish its identity.</p>

<p>Lysin has the composition of C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, being a
diamido-caproic acid, a homologue of diamido-valerianic<span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span>
acid. Hence, this body, like leucin or amido-caproic acid,
is a representative of the fatty acid group, the chemical
relationship between the two bodies being plainly apparent
from their constitution. The constitution of lysatinin is
less definitely settled, but apparently it has the composition
of a creatin, its formula being C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>13</sub>N<sub>3</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in which case it
might be more appropriately termed lysatin. The special
point of interest, however, connected with this latter body
as a product of trypsin-proteolysis is the fact that by simple
hydrolytic decomposition, all chance of oxidation being
excluded, it can break down into urea<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></span> For years, chemists
have been seeking to trace out the line of cleavage or
decomposition by which urea results in proteid metabolism.
In the nutritional changes of the body, nearly all the nitrogen
of the ingested proteid food is excreted in the form of
urea, but chemists working with dead food-albumin have
been heretofore unable to break down proteid matter
directly into urea. This, however, Drechsel has now succeeded
in doing, and it is to be especially noted that the
line of decomposition or cleavage is simply one of hydration,
in which the proteid molecule, either through the
action of boiling dilute acids, or through the more subtle
influence of the hydrolytic enzyme, trypsin, is gradually
broken down into cleavage products, from one or more of
which comes lysatin. The very resemblance of this body
to creatin suggested that, since the latter breaks down into
urea and sarcosin when boiled with baryta water, lysatin
might possibly behave in a similar manner. This, as has
been previously stated, was found to be the case, and
Drechsel obtained from ten grammes of a double salt of
lysatin and silver one gramme of urea nitrate, by simple
boiling with baryta water.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span></p>
<p>It is thus evident that a certain amount of urea may
come from the more or less direct hydrolysis of proteid
matter in the intestinal canal, all but the last steps in the
process being the result of the ordinary cleavage processes
incidental to trypsin-proteolysis. This fact affords additional
evidence of the profound changes set in motion by
this proteolytic enzyme. It is not, of course, to be understood
that all the urea formed in the body has its origin in
this manner. Such a method of decomposition taking
place in the intestinal tract would be exceedingly unphysio­logical
and wasteful, but we can readily see how such a
line of cleavage might result in inestimable gain to the
economy in cases where excess of proteid food has been
ingested. Under such circumstances, a portion of the surplus
might be broken down directly in the intestine into
this urea-antecedent, and thus quickly removed from the
system with a minimum amount of effort on the part of
the economy. Drechsel estimates that about one-ninth of
the urea daily excreted may come from the direct decomposition
of lysatin, the latter obviously having its origin in
trypsin-proteolysis.</p>

<p>Another product of trypsin-proteolysis which has long
been recognized, although its real nature has not been
known, is tryptophan or proteino­chromogen. This body
is not only a product of the pancreatic digestion of proteids,
but it is also formed whenever native proteids are
broken down through any influence whatever, the substance
coming presumably from the hemi-moiety of the molecule.
It is especially characterized by the bright-colored compound
it forms with either chlorine or bromine, so that for
a long time it went by the mystical name of the “bromine
body.” When brought in contact with either of these
agents, it immediately combines with them to form a new
compound of an intense violet color, termed proteinochrome.<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
This constitutes the usual test for its presence, a little bromine
water, for example, quickly bringing out a violet
color when added to a fluid containing the chromogen. The
body is readily soluble in alcohol, and hence can be easily
separated from the primary products of trypsin-proteolysis,
such as the proteoses and peptones. Krukenberg considered
the substance not a true proteid, but rather a body
belonging to the indigo-group; but Stadelmann, who has
given the matter a very thorough investigation, comes to
the conclusion that it is truly a proteid body, in part closely
related to peptone, although in many ways quite different.</p>

<p>The following composition of bromine proteinochrome,
as determined by Stadelmann<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></span> shows the general nature of
the compound formed when bromine combines with the
chromogen:</p>

<div class="center">

<tr><td class="tal pr5">Br</td><td class="tac">19.95</td><td class="tac pl2"><span class="ilb">19.77</span></td></tr>
</table></div>

<p>From the average of the several results obtained, it
would appear that the proteino­chromogen, which could
not be isolated by itself in sufficient purity for analysis,
must contain approximately 61.02 per cent. of carbon, 6.89
per cent. of hydrogen, 13.68 per cent. of nitrogen, 4.69 per
cent. of sulphur, and 13.71 per cent. of oxygen. As a proteid-like
body, it is thus especially characterized by an
exceedingly high content of carbon and a high content of
sulphur. As a product of trypsin-proteolysis, it must presumably
come from the cleavage of hemipeptone, which,
however, contains only 0.75 per cent. of sulphur. But as<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
we have seen, this latter body breaks down by further
cleavage into substances such as leucin, tyrosin, lysin, etc.,
which contain no sulphur whatever, and as there is no
elimination of sulphur in this process through formation
of hydrogen sulphide gas or otherwise (putrefaction being
excluded by the presence of either chloroform or thymol),
it follows that this surplus sulphur must accumulate somewhere.
The high content of carbon, however, in proteino­chromogen
is sufficient evidence that the substance cannot
have its origin in a simple cleavage of hemipeptone. On
the other hand, everything points to a synthetical process, in
which two or more cleavage products of the proteid molecule
combine and form a new body, such as proteino­chromogen,
containing all the sulphur cast off from the hemipeptone
in the production of the crystalline bodies, and having
in itself properties common to peptone and to a body of
the indigo-group, the latter obviously coming from some
aromatic antecedent.</p>

<p>In view of the apparent complexity of the processes
attending trypsin-proteolysis, it is not strange that even
simpler substances than those already described should
make their appearance. Thus, when it was suggested that
ammonia, NH<sub>3</sub>, might be formed under the influence of
trypsin, it was not considered at all improbable, for in the
hydrolytic decomposition of proteids by boiling dilute acid,
as well as by baryta water, it had long been known as a
prominent product. Obviously, in trypsin-proteolysis, the
one thing to be guarded against in proving the formation
of ammonia is the contaminating influence of bacteria.
Hirschler<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></span> however, with a full recognition of this danger,
made digestions of blood-fibrin with trypsin extending only
through four hours and at a temperature of 32°&nbsp;C., and yet<span class="pagenum" title="108"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a></span>
he obtained plain evidence of the formation of ammonia.
Stadelmann<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></span> with still greater precautions to exclude all
bacterial agencies, using boiled fibrin as the material to be
digested and thymol to prevent any possible infection of the
digestive mixture, proved conclusively that ammonia was
formed as a result of trypsin-proteolysis. Thus, in the digestion
of 35 grammes of boiled blood-fibrin with 60&nbsp;c.&nbsp;c. of a
pancreas infusion for three days, 20.8 milligrammes of NH<sub>3</sub>
were developed, presumably coming from the liberation of
a certain amount of nitrogen attendant upon the formation
of such bodies as leucin and tyrosin, which contain considerably
less nitrogen than their direct antecedent hemipeptone,
or the original proteid. We thus have striking proof
of the ability of this peculiar proteolytic enzyme to set in
motion hydrolytic changes which may extend even to the
production of such simple substances as ammonia, thus making
still more striking the parallelism between trypsin-proteolysis
on the one hand, and the artificial hydrolysis produced
by boiling dilute acids on the other.</p>

<p>In view of all these facts regarding the nature of the
products obtainable by pancreatic proteolysis, it is very evident
that many chemical changes may take place side by
side in a vigorous pancreatic digestion of proteid matter.
We know without a shadow of doubt that all of the bodies
enumerated as products of pancreatic digestion are the
results of trypsin-proteolysis, and not the products of putrefactive
changes. Bacteria, it is true, are able to produce
many like products, and in the living intestinal tract exercise
an important influence, especially in the breaking down
of resistant forms of proteid matter, and in the decomposition
of surplus material which has escaped the pancreatic
ferment. But all the bodies described above are readily<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
obtainable by trypsin-proteolysis under conditions which
exclude all possibility of bacterial action.</p>

<p>Granting, then, as we must, that these various bodies are
all products of pancreatic proteolysis when the process is
carried on in beakers or flasks, we need to consider next
how far such bodies appear in the natural process as it
takes place in the living intestine. We know indeed that
the natural and the artificial processes are very much alike so
far as the qualitative results are concerned, but what differences
there may be between the quantitative relationships
in the two cases is less certain. One might naturally reason
that, with the facilities for rapid absorption that exist
in the small intestine, trypsin-proteolysis would rarely proceed
beyond the peptone stage, yet we have ample evidence
that, under some circumstances at least, both leucin and
tyrosin are formed in considerable quantities in the intestine.</p>

<p>It obviously makes a very great difference to the economy
in what form the proteid matter ingested leaves the
intestine on its way into the blood-current. It has been
more or less generally assumed that, under the ordinary
circumstances existent in the intestinal tract, the crystalline
and other bodies coming from the more profound
changes incidental to trypsin-digestion are rarely formed,
mainly on the ground that such trans­forma­tions would
entail great loss of nutritive material to the blood. Years
ago, Schmidt-<span class="nowrap">Mülheim<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></span> made a series of experiments on
the changes which proteid foods undergo in different portions
of the alimentary tract, from which he concluded
that leucin and tyrosin are formed in such small quantities
in natural pancreatic digestion that they represent only a
very small part of the nitrogen absorbed from the intestine.
This conclusion has been more or less generally<span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
accepted, especially as several observers have reported
finding only small amounts of these bodies in the intestine
under what might be assumed to be favorable circumstances
for their formation. In artificial digestions, on the
other hand, as we have seen, leucin and tyrosin, together
with the other simple bodies described, may appear in
large quantities. Obviously, two suggestions present themselves
as explanatory of this difference; either there is
such a rapid absorption of these crystalline products from
the intestine that they cannot be detected other than as
mere traces, or else the natural process takes a different
course from the artificial, owing to the rapid withdrawal
from the intestine of the antecedent of the leucin and
tyrosin, viz., the hemipeptone.</p>

<p>Concerning this point, <span class="nowrap">Lea<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></span> has recently reported some
experimental evidence obtained by a comparative study of
artificial pancreatic digestion as carried on in a flask, with
similar digestions carried on in parchment dialyzer tubes,
the latter so arranged that the diffusible products of proteolysis
can pass from the tube into the surrounding fluid.
As Lea justly says, this whole question of the formation of
leucin by proteolysis is a very important one, since it bears
closely upon one of the possible methods by which urea
may be quickly formed from proteid food. Thus, we have
evidence that when leucin is administered to mammals a
portion of its nitrogen, at least, quickly reappears as urea
and uric acid in the urine<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></span> Further, there is a certain
amount of evidence that this transformation takes place in
the liver, viz., in the organ where leucin absorbed from the
intestine would naturally be first carried<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span></p>

<p>Obviously, the main point to be gained in a dialyzer-experiment
is the removal of the soluble products of digestion
as soon as they are formed; but peptones are not
rapidly diffusible, and the process, as noted under the head
of gastric digestion, cannot be considered in any sense as
yielding the same results as might be obtained in the living
intestine. Still, the method offers a closer approach to
the natural process than when carried on in a flask, and
the results are of interest. Thus, Lea finds in the first
place that in a dialyzer-digestion the proteid is more
quickly dissolved, and that there is far less tendency for
the formation of an insoluble antialbumid with its natural
resistance to the ferment. Still, it is to be noticed that the
amount of this antialbumid-residue formed by trypsin-proteolysis
in a flask is mainly dependent upon the strength
of the ferment solution, and the character of the proteid
undergoing digestion. If the latter is in a fairly digestible
form, and the enzyme solution reasonably active, then even
the flask-digestion may show almost no residue of antialbumid.
Yet there is at least a shade of difference in the
two cases, which may be expressed by the statement that
trypsin-proteolysis, as carried on in a dialyzer-tube, is prone
to give less insoluble antialbumid than a corresponding
digestion in a flask. Further, the amount of leucin and
tyrosin formed in a flask-digestion is always greater than
in a dialyzer-digestion, other conditions being equal.
Naturally, these results help us very little in drawing any
conclusions regarding the extent to which leucin and tyrosin
may be formed in the intestine. They merely emphasize
the fact that the withdrawal of a certain quantity of
hemipeptone from the digestive mixture tends to reduce
by so much the yield of leucin and tyrosin. It is hardly to
be assumed, however, that the rate of withdrawal of peptone
from the intestine can keep pace with its formation,<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
especially when it is remembered that the proteid matter
coming into the small intestine, owing to its preliminary
treatment in the stomach, is in a comparatively digestible
condition. Further, the pancreatic juice is a remarkably
active fluid, and proteolysis under its influence must make
rapid strides. I can easily conceive that proteolysis by
trypsin, when carried on in a flask, may lead to the formation
of much larger amounts of leucin and tyrosin, and of
other bodies as well, than occurs in the natural process;
but there is certainly no ground for the belief that leucin
and tyrosin are wholly wanting in pancreatic proteolysis as
it occurs in the intestine.</p>

<p>With a view to obtaining some positive evidence on this
point I have tried a few experiments on animals, the
results of which have convinced me that, in the case of
dogs, at least, both leucin and tyrosin may be formed in
natural pancreatic digestion in considerable quantities.
Thus, in one experiment a good sized dog, kept without
food for two days, was fed four hundred grammes of chopped
lean beef at 8 <span class="lowercase smcap">A.M.</span> At 2 <span class="lowercase smcap">P.M.</span> the animal was killed and
the intestine ligatured close to the pylorus. The lower
end of the small intestine was likewise ligatured. The portion
inclosed between the two ligatures was then removed
from the body, and the contents of the intestine pressed
and rinsed out with distilled water. In the stomach, was
found a small amount of semi-digested matter weighing
about fifty grammes. The material obtained from the
intestine was strained through mull, the fluid rendered
faintly acid with acetic acid, and heated to boiling. The
clear filtrate from this precipitate was concentrated to a
very small volume, and while still hot precipitated with a
large amount of ninety-five per cent. alcohol. A small
gummy precipitate resulted, which was thoroughly
extracted with boiling alcohol and the washings added<span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>
to the alcoholic filtrate. The precipitate contained some
deutero­proteose and a small amount of true peptone.</p>

<p>The alcoholic fluids were evaporated to a small volume
and set aside in a cool place. As a result, quite a separation
of leucin and tyrosin occurred in the characteristic
crystalline forms. No attempt was made to effect a quantitative
separation of the two bodies, but the mixed precipitate
finally obtained weighed, after re­crystal­liza­tion,
over three-fourths of a gramme. Leucin was plainly in
excess, but considerable tyrosin must have been left in the
alcoholic precipitate, owing to its greater insolubility in
this menstruum. This experiment is almost a counterpart
of one reported by Lea<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></span> and like his indicates that both
leucin and tyrosin may be formed in not inconsiderable
quantities by pancreatic proteolysis as it occurs in the intestine.
This being so, one is naturally called on to explain
“the physiological significance of a process which at first
sight appears to result in a degradation of the potential
energy of proteids, under conditions such that the energy
set free can be of little use to the economy.<span class="nowrap">”<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></span> But it is
quite possible, as Lea has suggested, that these amido-bodies
have an important part to play in some of the synthetical
or other processes of the organism, and that their formation
is consequently necessary for the well-being of the
body. Whether this is so or not, we may well consider the
formation of these amido-acids in pancreatic proteolysis as
a means of quickly ridding the body of any excess of
ingested proteid food, with the least possible expenditure
of energy on the part of the system. This has always
seemed to me the probable purpose of the profound
changes which the pancreatic ferment is capable of inducing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span></p>

<p>The primary object of both gastric and pancreatic proteolysis
is to render the proteid foods more easily available
for the needs of the economy, viz., to aid in their absorption
and consequent distribution to the master tissues and
organs of the body. This is doubtless fully accomplished
by the formation of the so-called primary and secondary
products of proteolysis, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the proteoses and peptones
which are, comparatively, not far removed from the
mother-proteid, except in solubility and other minor
points. In the ferment trypsin, however, we have a
special agent endowed with the power of carrying on
the hydrolytic cleavage to a point where exceedingly simple
bodies result, and through whose agency any excess of
proteid material in the intestinal canal may be quickly
broken down into a row of products easily removed from
the system. It is to be remembered, however, that the
very nature of the proteid molecule precludes the possibility
of anything like a complete decomposition into
crystalline or other simple products. Full fifty per cent.
of the peptone formed must be antipeptone, which cannot
be further changed by trypsin under any circumstances, so
that, whether the amount of proteid in the intestine be
large or small, or whether it is exposed for a longer or
shorter period to trypsin-proteolysis, there will always be a
fairly large amount for absorption. This may well be considered
as one of the reasons for the peculiar structure of
the proteid molecule, the anti-group being always available
for the direct nutrition of the body, while the represen­ta­tives
of the hemi-group, especially when proteid is present
in excess, can be quickly and readily broken down into
simple products. In other words, the direct formation of
these simple bodies in the intestine furnishes a short path
to urea, thus leading to the rapid elimination of any excess
of proteid material.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span></p>

<p>We may well attribute to the epithelial cells of the
intestine the power, under normal circumstances, of regulating
and controlling, even though indirectly, the order of
events in the intestine. Just as the so-called secreting cells
of the <i>tubuli uriniferi</i> may lose for a time their power to
pick out from the blood material destined for the urine,
being clogged or exhausted by continued effort, so the
epithelial cells of the intestine, which play such an important
part in the absorption of proteid matters from the
alimentary tract, may, in the presence of an excess of proteid
matter, become temporarily exhausted, and, refusing
passage to the proteoses and peptone formed by proteolysis,
render possible further hydrolytic cleavage into
leucin, tyrosin, lysatin, etc.; bodies which, by one method
or another, can be readily transformed into urea. At the
same time, as already stated, it seems more than probable
that some formation of these amido-acids always occurs in
the intestine, and that these bodies have some specific part
to play in the normal processes of metabolism going on in
the body. The more one studies the processes of nutrition
in general, the more one is impressed with the view that
there is a purpose in everything, and that the formation of
even such bodies as leucin and tyrosin may be connected
with hidden processes, the key to which has not yet been
found. We see an analogous case, perhaps, in the action
of the inorganic salts in nutrition, some of which, at least,
neither undergo change themselves nor induce changes in
other substances, and yet we know their presence is indispensable
for keeping up the normal rhythm of the nutritional
processes of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span></p>


<h4>ABSORPTION OF THE MAIN PRODUCTS OF PROTEOLYSIS.</h4>

<p>In ordinary proteolytic action, both in the stomach and
intestine, it is very apparent that the primary products of
proteolysis, the proteoses and peptones, are the chief products
formed, and that under normal circumstances the
greater portion of the proteid food finds its way from the
alimentary canal into the blood, after transformation into
one or more of these two classes of products. At the
same time, it must be borne in mind that even the acid-albumin
formed by pepsin-hydrochloric acid may be
absorbed without undergoing further change. The view
once held, that the rate of absorption from the alimentary
tract stands in close relation to the diffusibility of the
products formed, and that non-diffusible substances are
incapable of absorption, is no longer tenable. Absorption
from the intestine is to be considered rather as a process
involving the vital activity of the epithelial cells of the
intestinal mucous membrane, where chemical affinities and
other like factors play an important part in determining
the rate and order of transference through the intestinal
walls into the blood and lymph. Thus, we have abundant
evidence that native proteids which have not undergone
proteolysis may be absorbed from the intestine, at least to
a certain extent, provided they have been dissolved; <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>,
converted into acid-albumin, or alkali-albuminate, by the
gastric or pancreatic juice. We have a practical demonstration
of this possibility in the early experiments of Voit
and Bauer<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></span> as well as in many later ones that need not be
mentioned here. Further, the recent experiments of
<span class="nowrap">Huber<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></span> have given us quantitative data on the rate of<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
absorption of fluid egg-albumin when introduced into the
large intestine in the form of a clyster, showing that even
fairly large amounts of a natural proteid may be absorbed
without undergoing proteolysis if mixed with a neutral
salt, like sodium chloride. To be sure, the rate of absorption
is greatly increased when the albumin has been peptonized,
but still absorption of the native proteid is possible
without the agency of proteolytic enzymes. When, however,
large amounts of egg-albumin are introduced into the
intestine, albuminuria may result, as you very well know.</p>

<p>Moreover, it is well known that the proteids of muscle-tissue,
in the form of syntonin, may be absorbed from the
large intestine without undergoing further hydration.
When introduced into the rectum of a hungry dog, the
excretion of urea may be at once increased and the animal
brought into a condition of nitrogenous equilibrium;
absorption taking place from a portion of the large intestine,
where proteolysis is never known to occur<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></span></p>

<p>Again, <span class="nowrap">Neumeister<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></span> has shown that the direct introduction
of syntonin, alkali-albuminate, crystalline phytovitellin,
as well as pure serum-albumin, into the blood of the
jugular vein is not attended with the appearance of albumin
in the urine. On the contrary, the proteid matter so
introduced appears to be assimilated and utilized for the
needs of the organism. Evidently, then, these substances
are not to be considered as foreign bodies, for if so the
kidneys would undoubtedly make some effort to remove
them from the circulation. It is to be noted, however,
that all native proteids are not assimilated in this manner,
as casein<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></span> gelatin<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></span> and especially egg-albumin. Thus,<span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
J.&nbsp;C. Lehman<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></span> working under Kühne’s direction, observed
that the injection of a carefully filtered solution of egg-albumin
into the veins of a dog was always accompanied
by albuminuria, while similar injections of Lieberkühn’s
sodium albuminate, or of syntonin from frog’s muscle,
failed to show any such result.</p>

<p>While these observations tend to show that some native
proteids may be absorbed from the alimentary tract without
previously undergoing proteolysis, it is not to be
understood that any considerable quantity is so absorbed
under normal circumstances. Doubtless, when small
amounts of proteid food are taken, its de­natural­iza­tion
by the primary action of the gastric or pancreatic juice,
viz., its conversion into syntonin or alkali-albuminate, may
be sufficient to insure its partial absorption, but digestive
proteolysis is unquestionably a necessary preliminary to
any general absorption, and there can be no manner of
doubt that the greater portion of the proteid food is
absorbed as proteoses and peptone. Peptones, as we have
seen, are possessed of a higher endosmotic equivalent than
the proteoses, but we need to keep continually in mind the
possibility that the selective power of the epithelial cells
of the intestinal mucosa may lead to as rapid transference
of the proteoses as of the more diffusible peptones. It is
not to be understood by this, however, that diffusibility is
of no consequence in determining the rate of absorption.
Surely, everything else being equal, the more diffusible
the substance the more rapid will be its passage from the
intestine into the blood-current. The more the process of
absorption is studied, however, the more clearly do we see
its dependence upon the functional power of the living
epithelial cells, a fact which plainly emphasizes the physiological
nature of the process.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span></p>

<p>Further, as already stated, absorption of proteid food-stuffs,
or their products, from the alimentary tract, is,
under ordinary circumstances at least, limited to the intestine;
from the stomach there is comparatively little
absorbed, and if necessary we might advance this fact as
an important argument against the theory of general
absorption of proteids in the form of acid-albumin. Even
such indifferent fluids as water, or physiological salt solution,
are absorbed with extreme slowness from the stomach<span class="nowrap">;<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></span>
this organ showing very little ability to take up
water even when the blood-vessels are dilated, as after the
ingestion of food.</p>

<p>This brings us to a very important point in connection
with the utilization by the system of the ordinary products
of proteolysis. The latter, as we have seen, are mainly
proteoses and peptones, and yet all the evidence points
clearly to the fact that these substances are never present,
at least in any quantity, in the blood or lymph, even when
digestive proteolysis is at its height. Further, the very
nature of the proteoses and peptones, their marked physiological
action when they are introduced directly into the
circulating blood, their rapid excretion, either as proteoses
or peptones, by the kidneys when so introduced<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></span> all indicate
that they are foreign substances, totally out of their
natural environment when introduced into the blood-current.
And yet we very well know that proteoses
especially are possessed of high nutritive qualities; they
are abundantly able to support animal life. Thus, <span class="nowrap">Politzer<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></span>
found by feeding experiments with heteroalbumose, dysalbumose,
and protoalbumose, that these bodies taken into<span class="pagenum" title="120"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a></span>
the stomach have the same nutritive value as meat. Various
feeding experiments with proteoses from different
sources, carried out in my laboratory on young dogs, have
shown conclusively that for short periods of time, at least,
these hydrolytic cleavage products are fully as capable of
sustaining the nitrogenous equilibrium of the body as the
proteids from which they are derived. In fact, the results
obtained favor the view that the proteoses, weight for
weight, possess a higher nutritive value than fresh beef<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></span>
It may be questionable, however, whether such a result
would follow in experiments conducted over longer periods
of time, but of this we may be certain, that the proteoses
formed in the alimentary tract can be absorbed and utilized
by the system without their exerting any toxic action
whatever.</p>

<p>Consequently, we are forced to the conclusion that these
primary products of proteolysis, so important in the nutrition
of the animal body, must undergo some change during
the process of absorption, by which they are converted into
new bodies, less toxic in their nature, and better adapted
for the direct nutritional needs of the organism. The
same statement applies likewise to peptones.</p>

<p>The fact that peptones are not discoverable in the blood
and lymph, even during or after active digestion, was
practically ascertained years ago by such well-known workers
as Maly, Adamkiewicz, and others. The natural supposition
following this observation was that the products
of proteolysis underwent some change in the hepatic cells;
but this view was soon shown to be untenable by examination
of the portal blood, which was found to be as free
from peptone as the blood of the hepatic vein. Neumeister<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></span>
using the more modern methods of work and with the<span class="pagenum" title="121"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a></span>
wider knowledge gained during these latter years, has
shown conclusively that proteoses and peptones are never
present in the blood, even when these substances are contained
in the intestine in fairly large amounts. I can
corroborate these statements from the results of my own
experiments in this direction. Thus, I have taken a dog
in full digestion, fed with an abundance of meat, and collecting
the blood from the carotid artery have made a
careful examination for peptone, by the following method:
The blood was allowed to flow directly into a dilute solution
of ammonium sulphate, sufficiently strong to prevent
coagulation, and then shaken with ether to rupture the red
blood-corpuscles. The solution, freed from ether, was next
saturated with crystals of ammonium sulphate, by which
the proteid matter was completely precipitated. The clear
filtrate was then concentrated somewhat, the excess of the
ammonium salt removed by filtration, and the filtrate carefully
tested for peptone by addition of a large volume of a
saturated solution of potassium hydroxide and a few drops
of a dilute solution of cupric sulphate. The test was
wholly negative, although the intestine of the animal
showed the presence of both peptone and proteoses. This
result, as I have said, is simply confirmatory of work done
by others in this direction, notably Neumeister, and illustrates
the statement that peptones are not to be found in
the circulating blood, even after a full proteid diet. In
this connection it is to be remembered that we have abundant
proof of the rapid disappearance of both proteoses
and <span class="nowrap">peptones<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></span> from the intestine, either by absorption or
otherwise. They certainly disappear, and, as we have
seen, are not to be found in the blood. Further, Neumeister
has confirmed the original observation of Schmidt-<span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>Mulheim<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></span>
that both chyle and lymph are practically free
from proteoses and peptone, thus again forcing us to the
conclusion that the primary products of proteolysis must
undergo change prior to their passage into the blood or
lymph.</p>

<p>Many observations lend favor to the view that a transformation
of some kind takes place in the intestine itself,
not indeed in the lumen of the tube, but somewhere in the
walls, through which the peptones must pass before reaching
the blood. Thus, peptones placed in contact with
pieces of the isolated, though still living, intestine, after a
time completely disappear from view<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></span> so completely that
no reaction can be obtained even by the most delicate of
tests. In support of this statement I may cite the results
of several of my own experiments which certainly furnish
evidence that true peptones undergo profound alteration
by simple contact with the living mucous membrane of the
small intestine. The method employed was similar to that
made use of some years ago in a study of the influence of
peptone on the post-mortem formation of sugar in the
liver<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></span> A large, well-nourished rabbit was killed by severing
the carotid artery and the blood collected and defibrinated.
Of this, 50&nbsp;c.&nbsp;c. were mixed with an equal volume of
0.5 per cent. salt solution containing 1.25 grammes of pure
amphopeptone, prepared from egg-albumin, the mixture
obviously containing 1.25 per cent. of peptone. The fluid
was transferred to a large, roomy flask, provided with a
stopper having two holes, in one of which was fitted a<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
long glass tube reaching below the fluid. The flask, with
its contents, was then placed in a suitable water-bath at a
temperature of 40°&nbsp;C.</p>

<p>The small intestine of the rabbit was carefully separated
from the mesentery and from the pancreatic gland, and the
upper portion cut open and quickly washed free from any
contained matter or adherent secretions, by repeated
immersion in 0.5 per cent. salt solution warmed at 40°&nbsp;C.
This was repeated until the tissue was quite free from all
impurities, after which it was cut into small pieces and
immersed for a moment in a 0.5 per cent. solution of
sodium chloride containing 1.25 per cent. of peptone.
The tissue was then carefully collected on coarse muslin,
allowed to drain, and then quickly transferred to the flask
containing the warm blood and peptone. This mixture
was kept at 40°&nbsp;C. for two hours, a slow current of air
being bubbled through the fluid during the entire period.
At the expiration of this time the fluid was separated from
the pieces of tissue by nitration through muslin, and then
saturated with ammonium sulphate after the usual method
for the separation of albumoses, etc. On now testing a
portion of the clear filtrate for peptone by the biuret test,
not a trace of a reaction could be obtained. The entire
amount of proteid matter present was precipitated by the
ammonium salt, thus showing that the peptone originally
added had been completely transformed into something
precipitable by saturation of the fluid with ammonium
sulphate. That this transformation of the peptone was
accomplished mainly through the action of the intestine,
was shown by a parallel experiment, in which all of the
above conditions were duplicated, omitting only the pieces
of intestine. Here, however, on testing the filtrate from
the ammonium sulphate-precipitate, a strong biuret reaction
was obtained, thus proving the presence of at least
some unaltered peptone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span></p>

<p>This experiment is almost a counterpart of one reported
by Neumeister, and like his, testifies to the probability
that the peptones formed in the alimentary tract, as a result
of proteolysis, undergo retrogression through the agency of
the epithelial cells of the intestinal walls during their
absorption. I have tried similar experiments with deutero­proteose,
notably with deuterocaseose, and have obtained
corresponding results. The same method may be employed
as that already outlined, although of course the deuterocaseose
is in great part precipitated by saturation with
ammonium sulphate. Still, this form of deutero­proteose,
β&nbsp;deuterocaseose, as I have elsewhere noted, is very slowly
precipitated by the ammonium salt. Consequently, it is
an easy matter to demonstrate that this proteose, on treatment
with the intestinal mucosa in the presence of blood
at the body-temperature, is transformed into something
completely and readily precipitable by ammonium sulphate;
the filtrate from the latter failing to show any
biuret reaction, although the corresponding control experiment
without the intestine gives a bright violet color with
cupric sulphate and potassium hydroxide.</p>

<p>Hence, we are certainly justified in saying that both
peptones and proteoses undergo some retrogression when
in contact with the walls of the intestine. Moreover,
there is some evidence that the proteoses, before undergoing
such a transformation, are first converted into peptone
by the action of the intestinal walls, a statement
which will apparently apply to both the primary and secondary
proteoses. This primary action of the intestinal
walls is not considered as due to any adherent trypsin, or
to possible traces of succus entericus, but rather as a part
of the action of the living epithelial cells, or perhaps as
connected with the possible presence of lower organisms
not removable from the intestinal wall by ordinary
washing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span></p>

<p>The transformation of peptones by the substance of the
intestine is apparently common to the intestinal tract of
many animals, and perhaps to all, and indeed can also be
accomplished by the liver<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">215</a></span> This latter fact is of some
importance, since it adds weight to the supposition that
this peculiar action of the intestine cannot be due to the
possible presence of trypsin; a view which is strengthened
by the fact that a glycerin-extract of the intestine has no
action on amphopeptone. Certainly, the latter shows no
diminution in the strength of the biuret reaction after
long contact at body temperature with such an extract.
Further, it has been shown that antipeptone, which is not
affected by the pancreatic enzyme, suffers the same change
as amphopeptone by contact with the intestine. Far more
probable is it that retrogression or transformation of peptone
by the substance of the intestine, is due to the vital
activity of some or all of the epithelial cells of the intestinal
mucosa; a characteristic possibly shared by some or all
of the hepatic cells of the liver. The kidney-cells certainly
do not possess this power, but we can see a special
fitness in the liver-cells being endowed with the ability to
quickly break down, or transform, any peptone or proteose
that might by chance escape unaltered from the intestinal
tract. Shore<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></span> however, inclines to the view that the
hepatic cells do not possess this power to any great extent,
in opposition to the older views of Plòsz and Gyergai<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></span> as
well as of <span class="nowrap">Seegen<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></span> and of Neumeister.</p>

<p>With reference to the action of the stomach-mucosa on
proteoses, it has been <span class="nowrap">shown<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></span> that when relatively large<span class="pagenum" title="126"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a></span>
amounts (5 grammes) are introduced into the stomach of a
rabbit, the pylorus being ligatured, both proteoses and
peptones may appear in the urine, thus indicating that
while they may be absorbed to some extent under the
above conditions, the proteoses are not readily transformed
into native proteids without exposure to the intestine.
Smaller amounts (2 grammes), however, may, under the
above conditions, be completely transformed; at least
Hildebrandt claims this to be the case, mainly on the
ground that after the introduction of albumoses into the
stomach, the pylorus being ligatured, no trace of them
can be found in the urine. The same observer also
claims that blood-serum, in the case of dogs, is able to
transform albumoses into ordinary serum-globulin. Certainly,
after intra-venous injection, proteoses disappear
from the blood, but, as we shall see later on, a certain
amount, at least, may be transferred to the lymph. It is
also claimed that when albumoses are injected subcutaneously,
neither albumoses nor peptones are to be detected in
the urine. This, however, seems hardly probable in the
light of what has been said, and especially in view of the
fact that Neumeister’s experiments tend to show that even
0.1 gramme of albumoses introduced subcutaneously may
give rise to temporary albuminuria.</p>

<p>Assuming for the moment that the chief products of
proteolysis, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, the proteoses and peptones, are, during
the act of absorption, transformed through the vital
processes of the epithelial cells of the intestine into serum-albumin,
or globulin, and absorbed as such into the blood,
we may well consider whether such transformation, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, a
retrogression into a native proteid again, is inconsistent, or
out of harmony, with the general character of the changes
known to occur in the body. In attempting to answer this
question we need not look far to find a perfectly analogous<span class="pagenum" title="127"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>
case. Thus, in the digestion of starchy foods by the
amylolytic ferments of both the saliva and the pancreatic
juice, the carbohydrate material undergoes hydration with
formation of dextrins and maltose, the latter, at least,
being quickly absorbed into the circulating blood. But
large quantities of sugar in the blood are certainly inimical
to the well-being of the organism, and we find in the liver a
tendency for the sugar to undergo a transformation, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, a
retrogression into glycogen, either through simple dehydration
or otherwise. Further, with reference to the possible
conversion of proteoses into peptone by the substance
of the intestine, we have a perfectly analogous case in the
behavior of the intestinal mucous membrane toward
maltose, the final product of amylolytic action. Thus,
according to the recent work of M.&nbsp;C. Tebb<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></span> the mucous
membrane of the intestine has the power of transforming
maltose into dextrose; simple warming at 40°&nbsp;C. of a solution
of maltose in 0.5 per cent. sodium carbonate with a
few grammes of the dried mucous membrane from the
intestine, being sufficient to insure a marked conversion of
maltose into the higher-reducing sugar, dextrose. This
observation, I can confirm from experiments just completed
in my own laboratory. This action is presumably
due to a ferment, which, according to Tebb, is widely distributed
throughout the body, being present not only in the
intestine, but also in the liver, kidney, spleen, striated muscle-tissue,
and, indeed, in the blood-serum; so that it would
appear that nearly all the tissues of the body are endowed
with the power of transforming maltose into dextrose.
These statements being correct, it would seem that, while
the amylolytic ferments of the several digestive juices
transform, by hydrolytic action, starchy foods into malt<span class="pagenum" title="128"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>ose,
the latter is exposed during its passage through the
intestinal wall, as well as in the blood itself, to another
ferment which carries the hydration still further, with
formation of dextrose; and yet the latter product is destined,
in part at least, to undergo retrogression into a
starch-like body, <i>i.&nbsp;e.</i>, glycogen, before it is completely
utilized by the system. Thus, the analogy between these
carbohydrate bodies and the products of proteolysis is
complete, and we may well accept the statements already
made regarding the ultimate fate of the proteoses and
peptones formed during proteolysis, as in no way inconsistent
with the general tenor of events going on in the
body.</p>

<p>While we are inclined to believe that the chemical
changes attending the absorption of proteoses and peptones
occur mainly in the epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa,
and that there is a direct transference of the alteration-products
to the blood, there are still other views that
cannot be wholly ignored. Thus, the view originally
advanced by Hofmeister<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></span> in which special stress is laid
upon the functional activity of the leucocytes of the
adenoid tissue surrounding the intestine, demands some
consideration. The theory supposes that these cells not
only have the power of taking up peptones, but also of
assimilating and transforming them into the cell-protoplasm.
This view being correct, it is plain that the so-absorbed
proteid must pass into the circulating blood
through the thoracic duct, and Hofmeister further considers
it probable that the lymph-cells of the mesenteric glands
can transform any absorbed peptone that may escape the
leucocytes of the adenoid tissue.</p>

<p>In apparent harmony with this view is the fact that the
leucocytes in the adenoid tissue of the intestine are greatly<span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
increased in number during digestion<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></span> Furthermore, it is
a well authenticated fact that the proteoses or peptones
found in pus are contained in the pus-cells themselves,
and not in the fluid in which the corpuscles float<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></span> In
support of the first statement, Pohl<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></span> in his recent study of
the absorption and assimilation of food-stuffs, has emphasized
the marked increase in the number of white
blood-corpuscles in the circulating blood after the ingestion
of proteid foods, especially such as meat, Witte’s
peptone, and gelatin-peptone. It is to be noted further
that the increase is most marked at about the third hour
after the taking of food, viz., at a time when digestive
proteolysis would naturally be at its height. Moreover,
the maximal increase, according to Pohl’s data, is astounding,
amounting as it does in many cases to a hundred per
cent. Thus, in one instance, in the case of a dog, the
number of white blood-corpuscles per cubic millimetre of
blood was 8,689; yet two hours after the feeding of 100
grammes of meat the number increased to 17,296 per cubic
millimetre, followed six hours after by a return to the
original figure.</p>

<p>This indicates the general tenor of Pohl’s results, which
have been taken, by some physiologists at least, as confirmatory
of Hofmeister’s views; the interpretation naturally
being that digestive proteolysis in the alimentary tract
is accompanied by a rapid production of new leucocytes in
the lymph-spaces surrounding the intestine, and followed
by a rapid transference of the corpuscles from their point
of origin to the circulating blood, from which they gradually
disappear as their material is made use of in the different
parts of the body. In harmony with this view,<span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span>
Pohl finds that there is a much larger number of leucocytes
in the blood and lymph flowing from the intestine of
an animal in full digestion, than in the arterial blood
coming to the intestinal tract. Further, when due consideration
is given to all the circumstances attending the
circulation of the blood through the abdominal organs, in
connection with the great increase in the number of leucocytes
during digestive proteolysis, it seems not unreasonable
to suppose that some proteid matter might be
transferred from the intestine to the blood during the
digestive period of six or eight hours. Moreover, if
Pohl’s views are correct, we see that a portion, at least, of
the proteid food-product may be transformed into organized
material in the body of the lymph-cell prior to its
passage into the blood, thus harmonizing with the statement
already made regarding the utter lack of proteoses
and peptones in the blood and lymph. This obviously
means an upbuilding of the ordinary products of digestive
proteolysis into the living protoplasm of the leucocytes in
the intestinal walls, implying, however, that the transformation
is accomplished solely by the leucocytes themselves,
and not by the epithelial cells of the intestine.</p>

<p>I have given this brief summary of Pohl’s work because
it is so closely in harmony with the original views of
Hofmeister, and because it offers an easy explanation of
one possible way in which some of the products of digestion
might perhaps pass from the intestine into the blood.
I am inclined to believe, however, that the so-called
digestive leucocytosis, which unquestionably does exist, is
not a direct result of digestive proteolysis in general, but
rather an indirect result, coming from the stimulating
action of the nuclein, contained especially in animal cells.
Thus, it is a significant fact, as Pohl himself reports, that
wheat-bread, with its fairly large amount of proteid<span class="pagenum" title="131"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
matter, and which is fully capable of nourishing the animal
body, fails to exert any influence on the number of leucocytes
in the blood. Yet we know that the gluten and
other proteids of wheat-flour are converted by digestive
proteolysis into proteoses and peptones, with the same
general properties as like products of animal origin.</p>

<p>In this connection we may note the experiments of
Horbaczewski<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></span> which show that nuclein administered to
a healthy man will give rise to a very marked increase in
the number of leucocytes in the blood. Thus, a few
grammes of nuclein may produce as striking a condition of
leucocytosis as a large amount of proteid food, due no
doubt to proliferation of the lymphoid elements of all the
lymphatic tissues of the body. Horbaczewski has reported
that the mere injection of 0.25 gramme of nuclein, in the
case of rabbits, will cause marked enlargement of the
spleen, with striking karyokinetic changes. Hence, it may
be assumed that whenever nuclein is set free in the body,
leucocytosis may result, provided the nuclein passes into
the circulation and is not decomposed immediately after its
liberation.</p>

<p>These facts, it appears to me, offer a more consistent line
of explanation of digestive leucocytosis than that advanced
by Pohl. All animal foods, especially meat of various
kinds and milk, contain considerable nuclein or nucleo-albumins,
which, by the action of the gastric juice, are liberated
and partially digested, but the nuclein is certainly not
dissolved. Nucleins, however, are soluble in weak alkaline
fluids, and when exposed to the action of the alkaline
pancreatic juice in the intestine, are in great part dissolved.
Thus, <span class="nowrap">Popoff<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></span> has reported that different varieties of nuclein
behave somewhat differently in the intestine, according<span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>
to their origin. In young and tender tissues, solution of
the contained nuclein through the alkaline fluids of the
intestinal canal is fairly complete, while the older products
are somewhat more resistant both to the pancreatic juice
and to the putrefactive processes common to the intestine.
However, experiments show that the greater portion of
the nuclein of ordinary proteid foods is dissolved in the
intestine, and absorbed as such in a practically unaltered
form. Consequently, passing into the adenoid tissue surrounding
the intestine, it has a marked stimulating action
on the lymphoid elements, accompanied by a noticeable
increase in the number of leucocytes, which are perhaps
produced at the expense of a portion of the proteoses and
peptones formed during proteolysis.</p>

<p>Thus, my interpretation of these results would lead me
simply to the admission that, possibly, a portion of the
products of proteolysis might pass from the intestine into
the blood-current indirectly, through the bodies of the
leucocytes formed in the adenoid tissue of the intestine.
But even admitting this, we lack positive proof of any
direct transformation of proteoses and peptones into the
organized material of the white blood-corpuscles, for it
may be that the above products are first transformed
through other agencies into serum-albumin, or other like
proteids. There are, indeed, many facts which are plainly
opposed to any marked absorption and transformation of
peptones by the leucocytes of the intestinal mucous membrane.
Thus, <span class="nowrap">Heidenhain<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></span> has severely criticised the
theory on the ground that there is very little increase in
the flow of lymph from the thoracic duct during absorption,
and further that the small percentage of proteid
matter in the chyle (about 2.0 per cent.) cannot account<span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>
for the large amount of proteid absorbed. Further, the
objection is made that the leucocytes present in the intestinal
mucosa, though numerous, are wholly inadequate to
assimilate any large proportion of the ingested proteid
food.</p>

<p>Still greater stress, however, may be laid upon the fact
that experimental evidence points to the conclusion that
lymph-cells cannot assimilate either peptones or proteoses.
Thus, quite recently, <span class="nowrap">Shore<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></span> has studied the results following
the introduction of a mixture of such products into
the lymphatic system by secretion, by absorption, and by
direct injection into a lymphatic vessel. Preliminary
experiments on dogs showed that when peptone is introduced
into the bile-duct it gradually appears in the lymph
of the thoracic duct, consequently this method can be
made use of as a means of ascertaining the fate of peptone
so absorbed into the lymphatic system. The results
obtained, using the ammonium sulphate method for the
isolation of the peptone, showed that when peptone is
injected into the bile-duct with sufficient force to overcome
the low pressure under which bile is secreted, there is an
increase in the rate of flow of lymph from the thoracic
duct. Further, while peptone is somewhat slow in appearing
in the lymph it eventually makes its appearance there,
in from sixty to one hundred and forty minutes after its
injection into the bile-duct. A certain amount of peptone
naturally passes into the blood, but is then rapidly excreted
through the urine. When, however, the renal vessels are
ligatured, peptone still rapidly disappears from the blood,
but then passes into the lymph, and under such circumstances
can be detected in the lymph as early as thirty-eight
minutes after its injection into the bile-duct. These<span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
results, therefore, do not accord with the view that peptones
suffer marked transformation by contact with lymph-cells,
for when only three-fourths of a gramme of peptone
is introduced into the bile-duct, unaltered peptone can be
detected in the lymph of the thoracic duct seventy to
ninety minutes after its injection.</p>

<p>With reference to the fate of peptone when it passes by
secretion into the lymphatic system, it will be remembered
that <span class="nowrap">Heidenhain<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></span> has shown that the injection of peptone
into the blood may be followed by a large increase in the
rate of flow of lymph. Further, the amount of solids in
the lymph, especially of proteids, is considerably increased.
From these and other facts, Heidenhain is led to the view
that the formation of lymph is a true secretion from the
blood-vessels. Shore finds that when small amounts of
peptone are slowly injected into the blood, there is generally
only a slight acceleration in the flow of lymph, but
the clotting power of the lymph is affected in a remarkable
manner. Thus, about twenty minutes after the commencement
of the injection the lymph loses entirely its
power of coagulating. This continues for about twenty
minutes, and then, in spite of the fact that the injection is
being continued, the lymph rapidly regains its power of
clotting, and finally coagulates quicker and firmer than
before. This peculiar action of peptone on the clotting
power of lymph may frequently be observed, even when
the amount of peptone present is too small to be detected
with certainty by chemical methods. Thus, when peptone
in small quantity is injected very slowly into the blood,
the greater part of it escapes through the urine, but a
small fraction, sometimes too small to actually detect,
passes into the lymph and shows its presence by its peculiar
influence on the clotting of the fluid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="135"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135"></a></span></p>
<p>When, on the other hand, peptone is injected rapidly
into the blood, 0.3 to 0.6 gramme per kilo. during two to
ten minutes, it may disappear completely from the blood
in five to ten minutes after the end of the injection. In
such a case, the fall of blood-pressure induced leads to
more or less arrest of the renal secretion, peptone appearing
in large amount in the lymph; but there is no indication
of any alteration of the peptone by the lymph, or its
contained leucocytes. Thus, when there is no chance for
the peptone to escape from the body, as on ligation of the
renal vessels, the peptone injected into the blood is rapidly
thrown into the lymph, and from the lymph in the tissues
of the body it is gradually carried to the thoracic duct, and
then again passes into the blood; all of which shows that
there is little or no transformation of the peptone by the
leucocytes of the lymphatic system.</p>

<p>Further, by direct injection of peptone into a lymphatic
vessel, Shore has shown that even so small an amount as
0.049 gramme is not assimilated or transformed by the
lymph in half an hour. Consequently, we seem to have
strong evidence that peptones are not prone to direct alteration
of any kind by the leucocytes of the lymphatic
system. Further, it would appear that the lymphoid cells
of the spleen are equally unable to assimilate small
amounts of peptone injected into the splenic artery.
Leucocytes, then, can play no direct part in the absorption
of the products of proteolysis from the intestine; the
lymph is normally free from both proteoses and peptones,
and the leucocytes plainly have no power to transform
these bodies into other forms. They can only utilize the
proteid material elaborated from the products of proteolysis
by other agencies.</p>

<p>Plainly, proteoses and peptones in the blood and lymph
are foreign substances. When present in the circulation<span class="pagenum" title="136"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a></span>
they give rise, as we have seen, to an increased flow of
lymph and to a change in the coagulability of the blood.
Further, not only is the flow of lymph augmented but
there is likewise an increase in the amount of solid matter,
while a corresponding decrease is noticed in the solid
matter of the blood-plasma. This fact obviously gives
support to the view that the increased formation of lymph
after the injection of peptone is due to an active process of
secretion by the endothelium cells of the capillary walls<span class="nowrap">.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></span>
Further, as we have seen, peptone disappears from the
blood more or less rapidly after its injection, so that it is
quite possible that the loss or alteration of the coagulability
of the blood may not be due to the peptone itself,
but rather to an altered condition of the blood induced by
the peptone. Moreover, this altered condition of the blood
may be the real cause of the increased transudation, or
secretion of lymph so conspicuous after the injection of
peptone. Starling, however, by carefully conducted experiments
on dogs finds, in conformity with Heidenhain’s
views, that peptone injected into the blood exercises a
direct excitatory effect on the endothelial cells, causing
thereby an increased flow of lymph; the increased flow
being in no way caused by the change in the blood that
is simultaneously produced. Further, it would appear,
according to Starling’s views, that the change in the coagulability
of the blood is not due to the effect of the peptone
on the endothelial cells of the blood-vessels, or at
least on their lymph-producing functions. Thus, the
injection of peptone may result in an action on the endothelial
cells of the blood-vessels, thereby increasing the
flow of lymph, or on the blood itself with a destruction or
diminution of the clotting power of the blood; the two<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
results being more or less independent. Further, the
rapid transferences of peptone from the blood to the
lymph is effected by the selective activity of the endothelial
cells of the vessel-wall, and according to Starling it is
probable that a preponderating part is played by the
endothelial cells of the renal capillaries.</p>

<p>In view of all these statements, it is very evident that
proteoses and peptones once outside the limits of the
alimentary tract may be passed about from organ to organ
and from secretion to secretion, inducing changes here and
there in their course, but suffering very little change themselves.
The main efforts of the system are directed to the
removal of these unwelcome strangers as speedily as possible,
for their marked physiological action renders them
somewhat dangerous visitors.</p>

<p>As normal products of digestive proteolysis, they are
never found beyond the limits of the gastro-intestinal
canal, but undergo retrogression in their passage through
the epithelial cells of the intestinal wall, being presumably
converted thereby into serum-albumin<span class="nowrap">,<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></span> which can be
directly utilized for the nutrition of the body; a conversion
which is plainly dependent upon certain inherent
qualities of the living epithelial cells, and is doubtless of
the nature of a dehydration.</p>
